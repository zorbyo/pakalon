# Development Rules

## Default Context

This repo contains multiple packages, but **`packages/coding-agent/`** is the primary focus. Unless otherwise specified, assume work refers to this package.

**Terminology**: When the user says "agent" or asks "why is agent doing X", they mean the **coding-agent package implementation**, not you (the assistant). The coding-agent is a CLI tool — questions about its behavior refer to code in `packages/coding-agent/`, not your current session.

### Package Structure

| Package                 | Description                                          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages/ai`           | Multi-provider LLM client with streaming support     |
| `packages/agent`        | Agent runtime with tool calling and state management |
| `packages/coding-agent` | Main CLI application (primary focus)                 |
| `packages/tui`          | Terminal UI library with differential rendering      |
| `packages/natives`      | Bindings for native text/image/grep operations       |
| `packages/stats`        | Local observability dashboard (`pakalon stats`)      |
| `packages/utils`        | Shared utilities (logger, streams, temp files)       |
| `crates/pi-natives`     | Rust crate for performance-critical text/grep ops    |

## Code Quality

- No `any` unless absolutely necessary.
- **NEVER use `ReturnType<>`** — use the actual type name.
- **NEVER use inline imports** — no `await import()`, no `import("pkg").Type` in type positions, no dynamic type imports. Always top-level.
- Check `node_modules` for external API types instead of guessing.
- **Barrel exports**: prefer `export * from "./module"` over named re-exports, including `export type { ... } from`. In pure `index.ts` barrels, use star re-exports even for single-specifier cases. If stars create ambiguity, remove the redundant export path; do not keep duplicates.
- **Class privacy**: use ES `#private` fields; leave externally accessible members bare. **No `private`/`protected`/`public` keyword on fields or methods**, except on **constructor parameter properties** where TypeScript requires it (e.g. `constructor(private readonly session: ToolSession)`).
- **Promises**: use `Promise.withResolvers()` instead of `new Promise((resolve, reject) => ...)`.
- **Prompts**: never build prompts in code (no inline strings, template literals, or concatenation). Prompts live in static `.md` files; use Handlebars for dynamic content. Import them via `import content from "./prompt.md" with { type: "text" }` — not `readFile`.
- **Worker scripts**: spawn workers with the dev/compile-safe hybrid pattern. `with { type: "file" }` only copies the entry as a raw asset and does **not** bundle its imports — workers crashed silently in compiled binaries on every prior incarnation of that pattern (issues #1011, #1027). Use this shape instead:
  ```ts
  import { isCompiledBinary } from "@oh-my-pi/pi-utils";
  const worker = isCompiledBinary()
  	? new Worker("./packages/<pkg>/src/<worker>.ts", { type: "module" })
  	: new Worker(new URL("./<worker>.ts", import.meta.url).href, { type: "module" });
  ```
  The literal in the compiled branch is what Bun's `--compile` static analyzer needs to discover the worker — its path is **`--root`-relative** (repo root, since `build-binary.ts` passes `--root ../..`), so it must start with `./packages/...`. The `new URL` form in the dev branch keeps spawns portable across cwds.
  In addition, every worker entry **MUST** be listed as an extra `--compile` entrypoint in `packages/coding-agent/scripts/build-binary.ts`. Without that the analyzer sees the literal but the worker never gets emitted into bunfs. The three current entries (`sync-worker.ts`, `tab-worker-entry.ts`, `worker-entry.ts`) live there as the working reference.
  Validate any new worker with the dedicated smoke probe: `pakalon --smoke-test` spawns the stats sync worker, pings it, and exits — it's wired into `ci:test:smoke` and `scripts/install-tests/run-ci.sh` so binary, source-link, and tarball installs all exercise it. Add a sibling smoke if the new worker is on a different module graph.

## Bun Over Node

Use Bun APIs where they provide a cleaner alternative; fall back to `node:*` only for what Bun doesn't cover. **Never spawn shell commands for operations with proper APIs** (e.g., don't `Bun.spawnSync(["mkdir", "-p", dir])` — use `mkdirSync`).

### Quick reference

| Operation       | Use                                       | Not                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| File read/write | `Bun.file()`, `Bun.write()`               | `readFileSync`, `writeFileSync` |
| Spawn process   | `` $`cmd` ``, `Bun.spawn()`               | `child_process`                 |
| Sleep           | `Bun.sleep(ms)`                           | `setTimeout` promise            |
| Binary lookup   | `$which("git")` from `@oh-my-pi/pi-utils` | `spawnSync(["which", "git"])`   |
| HTTP server     | `Bun.serve()`                             | `http.createServer()`           |
| SQLite          | `bun:sqlite`                              | `better-sqlite3`                |
| Hashing         | `Bun.hash()`, `Bun.password.*`, WebCrypto | `node:crypto`                   |
| Path resolution | `import.meta.dir`, `import.meta.path`     | `fileURLToPath` dance           |
| JSON5           | `Bun.JSON5.parse()` / `.stringify()`      | `json5` package                 |
| JSONL           | `Bun.JSONL.parse()` / `.parseChunk()`     | `text.split("\n").map(JSON.parse)` |
| String width    | `Bun.stringWidth()`                       | `get-east-asian-width`, custom  |
| Text wrapping   | `Bun.wrapAnsi()`                          | custom ANSI-aware wrappers      |

### Process execution

Prefer Bun Shell (`` $`cmd` ``) for simple commands:

```typescript
import { $ } from "bun";

const result = await $`git status`.cwd(dir).quiet().nothrow();
if (result.exitCode === 0) {
	const text = result.text();
}

$`do-stuff ${tmpFile}`.quiet().nothrow(); // fire and forget
```

Methods: `.quiet()`, `.nothrow()`, `.text()`, `.cwd(path)`.

Use `Bun.spawn`/`Bun.spawnSync` only for: long-running processes (LSP, kernels), streaming stdin/stdout/stderr (SSE, JSON-RPC), or process control (signals, kill, complex lifecycle).

When using `pipe` mode, cast the stream:
```typescript
const child = Bun.spawn(["cmd"], { stdout: "pipe", stderr: "pipe" });
const reader = (child.stdout as ReadableStream<Uint8Array>).getReader();
```

### Node module imports

Always use **namespace imports** for `node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:os`:

```typescript
import * as fs from "node:fs/promises";
import * as path from "node:path";
import * as os from "node:os";
```

- Async-only file → `node:fs/promises`.
- Needs both sync and async → `node:fs`, then `fs.promises.xxx` for async.

### File I/O

Prefer Bun:
```typescript
const text = await Bun.file(path).text();
const data = await Bun.file(path).json();
await Bun.write(path, data); // auto-creates parent dirs
```

Use `node:fs/promises` for directory ops (`fs.mkdir`, `fs.rm`, `fs.readdir`) — Bun has no native directory APIs. Avoid sync APIs in async flows; use sync only when forced by a synchronous interface.

**Anti-patterns:**
- `existsSync`/`readFileSync`/`writeFileSync` in async code → `Bun.file()` APIs.
- `mkdir(dirname(path), …)` before `Bun.write(path, …)` → redundant; `Bun.write` handles it.
- `if (await file.exists()) { await file.json() }` → two syscalls plus race. Use try-catch with `isEnoent`:
  ```typescript
  import { isEnoent } from "@oh-my-pi/pi-utils";
  try {
  	return await Bun.file(path).json();
  } catch (err) {
  	if (isEnoent(err)) return null;
  	throw err;
  }
  ```
- Multiple `Bun.file(path)` handles for the same path (including across `checkX`/`loadX` helpers).
- `Buffer.from(await Bun.file(x).arrayBuffer())` → `await fs.readFile(path)`.
- Existence check + try-catch around the same read → drop the existence check.

### Streams

Prefer centralized helpers:
```typescript
import { readStream, readLines } from "./utils/stream";
const text = await readStream(child.stdout);
for await (const line of readLines(stream)) { /* ... */ }
```
Manual reader loops only when the protocol requires it (SSE, streaming JSON-RPC).

### Misc

- **Sleep**: `await Bun.sleep(ms)`, never `new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, ms))`.
- **Password hashing**: `Bun.password.hash(pw, "bcrypt")` / `Bun.password.verify(pw, hash)`.
- **String width**: `Bun.stringWidth(text, { countAnsiEscapeCodes?: false })`.
- **Wrapping**: `Bun.wrapAnsi(text, width, { wordWrap, hard, trim })`.

## Generated Files

**NEVER edit `packages/ai/src/models.json` directly.** It is generated from upstream sources (models.dev, provider catalog discovery, OpenCode docs) by `packages/ai/scripts/generate-models.ts` and the descriptors/resolvers in `packages/ai/src/provider-models/`. Hand-edits get overwritten on the next regen.

To change an entry, fix the source:
- **Resolution rules / per-id overrides** → relevant resolver in `packages/ai/src/provider-models/openai-compat.ts` (e.g. `createOpenCodeApiResolution`'s id-override map).
- **Provider descriptors** (filtering, transforms, defaults, headers, compat overrides) → `packages/ai/src/provider-models/descriptors.ts` or the provider-specific descriptor.
- **Generator-level fixups** (premium multipliers, codex pricing fallback, fallback models, post-processing) → `packages/ai/scripts/generate-models.ts`.
- **Thinking metadata / generated policies** → `packages/ai/src/model-thinking.ts` (`applyGeneratedModelPolicies`).

Regenerate with `bun --cwd=packages/ai run generate-models` and commit `models.json` alongside the source change. Add a regression test against the **resolver/descriptor**, not the bundled JSON, so it survives upstream metadata shifts.

## Logging

**NEVER use `console.log`/`error`/`warn`** in the coding-agent package — it corrupts TUI rendering. Use the centralized logger:

```typescript
import { logger } from "@oh-my-pi/pi-utils";

logger.error("MCP request failed", { url, method });
logger.warn("Theme file invalid, using fallback", { path });
logger.debug("LSP fallback triggered", { reason });
```

Logs go to `~/.omp/logs/omp.YYYY-MM-DD.log` with automatic rotation.

## TUI Sanitization

All text displayed in tool renderers must be sanitized. Raw content (file contents, error messages, tool output) breaks terminal rendering: tabs → visual holes, long lines → overflow, paths → leak home directory.

**Rules:**
- **Tabs → spaces** via `replaceTabs()` (from `@oh-my-pi/pi-tui` or `../tools/render-utils`).
- **Truncate** lines with `truncateToWidth()` / `ui.truncate()`. Use `TRUNCATE_LENGTHS` constants.
- **Shorten paths** with `shortenPath()` (replaces home with `~`).
- **Preview limits** from `PREVIEW_LIMITS`. No ad-hoc numbers.

**Apply to every render path**, not just the happy one:
- Success output (file previews, command output, search results).
- **Error messages** — these often embed file content (e.g., patch failure messages include unmatched lines). If a message contains file content, it needs `replaceTabs()`.
- Diff content (added and removed).
- Streaming previews.

### Streaming tool previews

Tool-call previews can have **multiple render paths**. If you add preview-only fields or depend on partially streamed args, update every path — not only the final renderer.

For the bash tool specifically:
- The pending preview may need raw `partialJson`, not just parsed `arguments`. Parsed args lag until a JSON object closes, which makes inline env assignments appear only at the end.
- Preserve preview-only fields (e.g. `__partialJson`) through `event-controller.ts`, transcript rebuilds in `ui-helpers.ts`, and merged call/result rendering in `tool-execution.ts`. Missing one path causes inconsistent previews.
- `ToolExecutionComponent.#buildRenderContext()` for bash must work even before a result exists — the renderer uses call args plus render context to show the command preview while streaming.
- Verify both live streaming and rebuilt transcript paths after any bash preview change. A fix in one path does not fix the other.

## Commands

- NEVER commit unless asked.
- Never use `tsc`/`npx tsc` — always `bun check`.

## Testing Guidance

Test the contract the system exposes — not the easiest internal detail to assert.

- Every new test must defend one **concrete, externally observable contract**: behavior, output shape, state transition, error mapping, or a regression-prone parsing boundary. If you cannot name the contract, do not add the test.
- No placeholder tests, tautologies, or "the code ran" assertions (`expect(true).toBe(true)`, bare `not.toThrow()`, non-empty string checks, length-grew checks, "prompt exists" checks without semantic assertion).
- Prefer contract-level tests over implementation details. Avoid asserting internal helper wiring, field assignment, singleton identity, incidental ordering, prompt boilerplate, or passthrough option forwarding unless another component depends on that exact detail.
- Don't duplicate coverage across abstraction levels. If an integration test already proves the behavior, drop the narrower unit test that restates it through mocks.
- Tests **must be full-suite safe**, not just file-local safe. No long-lived file-wide mutations of `Bun.*`, `process.platform`, `process.env`, or `Bun.env` when a narrower seam exists. Prefer per-test `vi.spyOn(...)` with `vi.restoreAllMocks()` in `afterEach`. A test that passes alone but poisons later files is broken.
- **Never use `mock.module()`**. Bun's `mock.module()` mutates the global module registry and leaks across files ([oven-sh/bun#12823](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/12823)). Use `spyOn` on the imported module object instead. For pass deps, import the pass and spy on `.run`. For package deps, namespace-import and spy on the exported function.
- For lifecycle/stateful code, prefer one test per invariant or transition over several tiny tests asserting one field each from the same transition.
- For error handling, trigger the real failure path and assert the surfaced contract — don't instantiate error classes directly or inspect internal metadata.
- Smoke tests are acceptable only when they catch a failure mode narrower tests would miss. "Package boots" or "command starts" alone is not enough.
- Assert exact strings, ordering, and formatting only when downstream code parses or depends on the exact bytes. Otherwise assert semantic content.
- Compile-time guarantees → type checks/type tests, not runtime placeholders.
- Don't add tests for tiny low-risk changes unless they protect a real contract or fix a regression-prone edge case.
- Prefer focused package-local verification for the changed area.
