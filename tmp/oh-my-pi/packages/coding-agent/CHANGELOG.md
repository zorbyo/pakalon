# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Python bridge** (`python/robomp/src/bridge/`) — FastAPI router for the Pakalon cloud backend.
  - `POST /auth/device-code` issues 6-digit codes; `POST /auth/web-link` lets the web companion link the code to a user; `POST /auth/token` mints + verifies HMAC-SHA256 JWTs; `POST /auth/logout` clears the stored hash.
  - `GET /billing/me` returns the current-period usage + breakdown + 10% platform fee.
  - `POST /billing/usage` accepts batched `UsageEvent` records.
  - `POST /billing/upgrade` creates a Polar checkout (mock in self-hosted mode).
  - `POST /billing/webhook` handles `subscription.created/canceled` and `invoice.created/paid`; HMAC-verified when `POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set.
  - `POST /agent/auditor` runs an LLM-powered or stub auditor over a project; supports HIL (returns a question + options) and YOLO (auto-dispatches remediators); max 10 iterations per the spec cap.
  - `GET /agent/auditor/latest` returns the most recent report for a project.
  - `GET /models` lists the cached OpenRouter catalog; free users see only `:free` models. `POST /models/refresh` re-fetches live (pro-only).
- **Bridge SQLite store** (`bridge/store.py`) — WAL-mode SQLite for `bridge_users`, `bridge_device_codes`, `bridge_usage`, `bridge_invoices`, `bridge_auditor`, `bridge_model_cache`, `bridge_telegram`. Thread-safe, follows the robomp `db.py` pattern.
- **OpenRouter model refresh cron** (`python/robomp/src/tasks/refresh_models.py`) — nightly catalog refresh; CLI: `python -m robomp.tasks.refresh_models`. Fetches live, tags `tier=free` for `:free` models, sorts newest-first, atomically replaces the cache.
- **Dunning email task** (`python/robomp/src/tasks/dunning.py`) — 7-day due-date cascade for invoices and free-tier expiry. Idempotent on `(user_id, invoice_id, day_offset)`. Pluggable email transport (Resend in production).
- **Phase 2 sub-modules** (`packages/coding-agent/src/extensibility/custom-commands/bundled/pakalon/phases/phase2/`): `planner.ts` (reads Phase 1 + builds a WireframeSpec with pages/sections/elements), `emitter.ts` (renders SVG + JSON + Penpot envelope, copies to `wireframes/`, writes `phase-2.md`).
- **Phase 3 dispatcher** (`phases/phase3/dispatcher.ts`) — `PHASE3_TASKS` with read/write contracts per subagent, `nextSubagent(ctx)` for sequential HIL/YOLO progression, `logExecution` for the execution log.
- **Phase 4 emitter** (`phases/phase4/emitter.ts`) — typed `Finding` schema, `buildWhiteboxXml` (per-tool, per-module, per-test sections), `buildBlackboxXml` (per-US scenarios), `emitPhase4Files` writes 5 subagent reports + the two XML files.
- **Phase 5 deployer** (`phases/phase5/deployer.ts`) — emits `Dockerfile`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.env.example`, `deploy.sh`, `phase-5.md`. Cloud target switch (AWS / DigitalOcean / Azure / GCP / None).
- **Phase 6 docgen** (`phases/phase6/docgen.ts`) — emits `doc.md` (user-facing), top-level `README.md`, `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `phase-6.md`. Reads Phase 1 docs to fill features, API, and architecture sections.
- **Static phase prompts** (`packages/coding-agent/src/prompts/phase-{1..6}/`) — Markdown files for planner, Q&A, agent-skills, repo-scan, wireframes, the 5 Phase 3 subagents, the 5 Phase 4 subagents, deployment, and documentation. Per the AGENTS.md "no inline strings" rule.
- **Python security orchestrator** (`python/robomp/src/security/__init__.py`) — runs the 5 security subagent toolchains (semgrep, sonarqube, gitleaks, bandit, findsecbugs, brakeman, eslint-security, owasp-zap, nikto, sqlmap, wapiti, xsstrike, nmap) plus pentest scripts. Free vs Pro tool gating per CLI-req.md §597-601.
- **`web_scrape` tool** (`packages/coding-agent/src/tools/web-scrape.ts`) — Firecrawl-first, direct-fetch + Mozilla Readability fallback. Returns clean markdown with link targets preserved.
- **`registry_rag` tool** (`packages/coding-agent/src/tools/registry-rag.ts`) — Jaccard-similarity search over a curated component registry. Reads `registry.json` from `.pakalon-agents/` or `~/.pakalon/`. Designed so the swap to `fastembed`-backed cosine similarity is a one-line change.
- **`video` tool** (`packages/coding-agent/src/tools/video.ts`) — ffmpeg keyframe extraction (every 2s, default) + per-frame vision model call. Stays offline-friendly: the per-frame `describeFrame` is deterministic so tests are stable.
- **Telemetry runtime integration** (`packages/coding-agent/src/telemetry/runtime.ts`) — wires `beginSession` / `recordPrompt` / `recordToolCall` / `recordModelUsage` / `endSession` into the agent lifecycle. Privacy mode redacts prompt previews.
- **Multi-session TUI view** (`packages/coding-agent/src/tui/multi-session-view.ts`) — `createMultiSessionView()` factory; renders the card grid via `renderDashboard`, handles `+` / Enter / Esc / Ctrl+M keys, returns the active session on Esc.
- **Bridge tests** (`python/robomp/tests/test_bridge.py`) — 26 tests covering the full bridge: store CRUD, auth device-code / web-link / token / logout flows, billing ingestion + summary math + Polar signature verification, auditor stub + YOLO + HIL + iteration cap + latest retrieval, models list + tier filtering + refresh gating.
- **Refresh-models tests** (`python/robomp/tests/test_refresh_models.py`) — 3 tests covering normalize + tier tagging, run_refresh contract, and network-error fallback.
- **Dunning tests** (`python/robomp/tests/test_dunning.py`) — 3 tests for invoice / trial windows and the run_dunning pass.
- **Security orchestrator tests** (`python/robomp/tests/test_security.py`) — 4 tests for tier gating and the run_all contract.
- **Telemetry tests** (`packages/coding-agent/src/telemetry/telemetry.test.ts`) — 12 tests covering storage creation, machine-ID rotation, privacy-mode redaction, event recording, and the runtime hooks.

### Changed

- **Auth router**: switched from `Annotated[..., Depends(...)]` to the classic `param: T = Depends(...)` syntax for compatibility with FastAPI 0.136 in the lockfile (the `Annotated + Depends` form is a no-op in this version and was being treated as a query param).

## [15.7.3] - 2026-05-31
### Added

- Added support for decimal and `k`/`m` suffix turn-budget directives, enabling budgets like `+1.5k` and `+2m` in eval message parsing
- Changed eval budget resolution to honor a user `+Nk` directive over an active Goal Mode limit while falling back to Goal Mode when no per-turn ceiling is set
- Added `agent()` eval options `agent_type`/`agentType`, `model`, `context`, and `label`, and returned structured JSON when `schema` is provided in JS and Python eval cells
- Added a live, Task-tool-style progress tree for eval `agent()` calls, drawn below the notebook (code cell) box. Each subagent surfaces as a status line (icon · id · tool count · context · cost, plus duration on completion) with its current tool/intent while running, and updates mid-execution rather than only at the cell's final result. Progress events coalesce per subagent id so the persisted event list stays bounded across many throttled ticks.
- Added `agent()` to the `eval` runtime so JS and Python cells can spawn one subagent through the existing task executor; JS eval also gained bounded `parallel()` and `pipeline()` helpers for orchestrating subagent calls.
- Added a `workflow` magic keyword (mirrors `orchestrate`/`ultrathink`): the standalone word glows amber→green in the editor and appends a hidden notice steering the model to author deterministic multi-subagent fan-outs in `eval` (agent/parallel/pipeline). Matching is whitespace-delimited and case-sensitive (lowercase only); the singular and plural both trigger, but capitalized forms, inflections like `workflowed`, and path-embedded occurrences like `workflow.ts` do not.
- Added `parallel()` and `pipeline()` to the Python `eval` runtime (thread-pool over the synchronous `agent()` bridge), mirroring the JS helpers: bounded pool (default 4, max 16), input-order preservation, a barrier between every `pipeline` stage, and contextvar propagation so `agent()` works inside worker threads.
- Added `log()`, `phase()`, and a `budget` object to both `eval` runtimes (Python and JS). `log`/`phase` emit progress/phase status lines; `budget.total`/`budget.spent()`/`budget.remaining()`/`budget.hard` expose a real per-turn output-token budget. A `+Nk` directive in the user's message sets an advisory budget (the model self-limits via `budget.remaining()`); `+Nk!` (or an active Goal Mode budget) makes it a hard ceiling that blocks further eval `agent()` spawns once reached. `budget.spent()` counts output tokens spent this turn across the main loop and all eval-spawned subagents.
- Added search support for virtual internal URLs (including `omp://` roots) by resolving and scanning in-memory internal resources as search targets alongside filesystem paths
- Added expansion of virtual internal URL search targets so `search` can match multiple internal documents when given `omp://`
- Added `/omfg <complaint>` slash command that drafts a TTSR rule from a complaint, validates it against the current conversation, saves it to project or `~/.omp/agent/rules`, and registers it live.
- Added `/shake` slash command and the `shake` / `shake-summary` compaction strategies that reduce context by mechanically dropping heavy content instead of LLM summarization. `/shake` (alias `/shake elide`) strips heavy tool-call results and large fenced/XML blocks, offloads the originals to one session artifact, and leaves a recoverable `artifact://<id>` placeholder; `/shake summary` compresses the same regions with a local on-device model (`providers.shakeSummaryModel`, default `qwen3-1.7b`) and falls back to elide per region when the model is unavailable; `/shake images` strips image blocks. Auto-maintenance honors the `shake` / `shake-summary` strategies (16k protect window); on context overflow a shake that reclaims nothing falls back to context-full summarization.
- Added `providers.shakeSummaryModel` setting selecting the local on-device model used by `/shake summary` and the `shake-summary` compaction strategy. Runs entirely on-device (downloads on first use) and never calls a remote/cloud LLM.

### Changed

- Changed the eval cell `timeout` from a hard wall-clock deadline to an inactivity (idle) budget: a cell is now interrupted only after going the full window with no progress signal, and every status event — `agent()` progress snapshots, `log()`/`phase()`, and tool-bridge activity — re-arms the watchdog. Long `agent()`/`parallel()` fanouts that keep reporting progress no longer time out mid-run (previously the kernel was killed at the fixed deadline even while subagents were actively progressing). Raw `print`/stdout does not reset the watchdog, so pure-compute runaway loops stay bounded; the timeout is driven entirely by the abort signal, so neither runtime arms a competing fixed timer.
- Fixed turn-budget parsing to match `+Nk` directives only at token boundaries, preventing values like `version 1.2.3`, `c++`, and `+500kfoo` from triggering a budget rule
- Changed overflowing provider, hook-option, branch-message, agent, extension, and session-tree pickers to support fuzzy type-to-filter search.
- Changed Shift+Ctrl+P to cycle role models backward instead of cycling forward without persisting.
- Changed empty prompt input so `?` inserts a literal question mark instead of opening `/hotkeys`; use `/hotkeys` explicitly for the shortcut reference.
- Changed `search` output to preserve full virtual and internal URL paths in grouped results and `details.files` instead of collapsing them to file basenames
- Changed `/omfg` to run up to three generation attempts with validation feedback and only prompt saving when no draft matches assistant history
- Changed `/omfg` to show a live draft panel with generation/validation/saving status and allow canceling an active rule request with `Esc`
- Changed keybindings config to use `~/.omp/agent/keybindings.yml`, with automatic migration from legacy `keybindings.json` and continued support for `keybindings.yaml`.
- Changed the local SQLite memory backend identifier from `mnemosyne` to `mnemopi`. Existing configs are migrated automatically on load: `memory.backend: mnemosyne` becomes `mnemopi` and the `mnemosyne.*` settings block is renamed to `mnemopi.*` (skipped when an explicit `mnemopi` block already exists).
- Changed the `ultrathink`/`orchestrate`/`workflow` magic keywords to be markdown-aware: the standalone word now also glows in the rendered user message bubble (matching the live editor), and neither the glow nor the hidden steering notice triggers when the keyword sits inside a fenced code block, an inline `` `code` `` span, or an XML/HTML section.

### Fixed

- Fixed Ctrl+O tool-result expansion on POSIX terminals so offscreen tool blocks rebuild native scrollback instead of leaving stale collapsed rows above the viewport.

### Removed

- Removed the `/drop-images` slash command; use `/shake images`, which strips every image from the session through the same `dropImages()` path.

### Fixed

- Fixed final `agent()` completion status emissions in eval cells so the last live progress snapshot now preserves accumulated subagent metrics such as tool count and cost
- Fixed `agent()` in eval to enforce plan-mode, spawn allowlist, and disabled-agent checks before launching subagents
- Fixed recursive `agent()` calls from eval by enforcing the existing max subagent depth limit
- Fixed runtime model switches (Ctrl+P cycling, `--model`, `/model`, model picker selections, and programmatic changes) so they no longer overwrite the persisted `modelRoles.default`; only the model picker's explicit "Set as default" action and settings changes persist the default.
- Fixed `search` to honor line-range suffixes on virtual internal URL targets so matches outside the requested ranges are no longer returned
- Fixed `search` to handle internal URLs without source files without incorrectly reporting `Path not found`, returning matches from virtual content instead
- Fixed `/omfg` parsing to tolerate fenced or noisy model output, normalize generated rule names, and reject invalid regex conditions before saving
- Fixed auto-thinking sessions to persist the concrete resolved effort after classification, so resuming the session restores that level instead of returning to pending `auto`.
- Fixed extension-registered CLI flags (e.g. `--spawn-peer <value>`) leaking into the initial prompt: argv is re-parsed once the extension flag set is known so flag values are consumed instead of becoming messages or being misread as `@file` arguments. Registered flags shadow same-named built-ins, so a colliding flag (e.g. plan-mode's `--plan`) is parsed with the extension's semantics rather than being consumed by the built-in branch (which would otherwise eat the following message and corrupt the built-in field). Extension flags and `@file` arguments are now resolved before the session is created, so an unreadable initial `@file` exits without leaving a junk session/terminal breadcrumb behind. ([#1503](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/1503))
- Fixed footer status-line truncation: the left stats and right model segments now truncate by terminal cell width (via `truncateToWidth`) and strip all VT/ANSI escapes (via `stripVTControlCharacters`) instead of a SGR-only regex plus code-point `substring`, so wide glyphs, OSC hyperlinks, and non-SGR sequences can no longer overflow the line.
- Fixed the streaming edit diff preview rendering a tall, half-empty box (and the earlier "box grows and shrinks repeatedly" stutter). A whole-file Myers re-diff is recomputed on every streamed chunk and its alignment is not monotonic in payload length, so a hunk-aware window that kept whole change segments gained and lost rows tick to tick; the prior high-water row reservation hid that stutter but padded the reserved height with blank rows, leaving a large empty rectangle whenever the diff shrank below its peak. The preview now pins a fixed-height trailing window to the bottom of the diff ("accept from the back"), so the box stays a steady, full window of real diff context instead of blank padding.
- Fixed duplicated/stale scrollback above a streaming tool result on POSIX terminals (macOS/Linux). A tool whose output grows and re-lays-out (e.g. an edit diff gaining hunks) re-renders rows that already scrolled into native scrollback; the unknown-viewport anti-yank deferral left the old copy in place while the new one rendered below, showing the block twice. The event controller now enables the TUI's eager native-scrollback rebuild while a foreground tool is executing (`setEagerNativeScrollbackRebuild`), so those offscreen re-renders rebuild history cleanly — a snap to the tail is acceptable mid-tool. Background-running tools and plain assistant-text streaming keep the no-yank deferral; the mode resets at each turn start.

## [15.7.2] - 2026-05-31
### Added

- Added `providers.autoThinkingModel` setting so users can choose the `auto` thinking classifier backend (online smol or local tiny-memory model)
- Added an `auto` thinking level that classifies each real user turn and resolves to a concrete low-through-xhigh effort, with online smol classification by default and an opt-in local on-device classifier.

### Changed

- Updated the interactive thinking selectors in model/model-role pickers and ACP thinking options to include `auto` as a selectable level
- Updated footer and status-line rendering to show `auto` while auto-thinking is being resolved and `auto → <level>` once it resolves
- Changed the local tiny-model device default to CPU on every platform; explicit `providers.tinyModelDevice` / `PI_TINY_DEVICE` values still opt into accelerated ONNX providers.

### Fixed

- Prevented auto-thinking classification from running on non-user synthetic turns and non-reasoning models, keeping the session on its provisional concrete effort
- Added a bounded auto-thinking classification path that falls back to the provisional effort on failures/timeouts so prompts continue without interruption
- Bypassed auto classifier for `ultrathink` prompts and resolved directly to the highest supported auto effort
- Fixed the JavaScript `eval` kernel crashing the whole process with a segfault (`SIGTRAP`, `getImportedModule` on a null record) when imported code reached a local module whose relative-import graph contains a cycle — e.g. `await import("…/edit/streaming.ts")`, or any workspace path with cyclic re-exports. The `LocalModuleLoader` linked and evaluated each local module individually inside the recursive `vm.SourceTextModule` linker callback, which re-entered Bun's `node:vm` module linker mid-instantiation and detonated JSC on the first cycle. The loader now constructs the entire local module graph first and drives a single `link()` + `evaluate()` from the graph root, so cyclic graphs instantiate in one pass; external (`node_modules`) modules stay eagerly loaded since they carry no imports and cannot form a cycle.
- Fixed the streaming `edit` preview rendering a blank box for hashline edits whose payload sits on the trailing in-flight line (the common single-op `replace`/`insert` case). The preview path trimmed that still-typing line before diffing, so a single-payload op collapsed to a "No changes" result — shown as an empty box — for almost the entire stream. Hashline previews now feed the raw in-flight text through `applyPartialTo`, whose streaming-tolerant parser drops a payload-less trailing op and projects a partially-typed payload line as it grows, so the diff appears and fills in live. Transient errors from the actively-typed trailing section are also suppressed while streaming (regardless of section count) so a mid-typed op can't wipe an already-good preview frame; real errors still surface once args are complete.
- Fixed hashline edit previews to accept live content-hash matches and session snapshot recovery, so `search`/`read`-anchored edits no longer flash stale "re-read" errors before applying successfully.

## [15.7.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- Added a `Web search` setup tab that lets users choose the preferred `providers.webSearch` provider during onboarding
- Added manual authorization-code/redirect URL prompts for OAuth providers that require non-callback login in the setup wizard
- Added an `omp completions <bash|zsh|fish>` command that prints a shell completion script generated from the live command/flag metadata, so completions never drift from the actual CLI. Subcommands, flags, and enum values complete statically; `--model`/`--smol`/`--slow`/`--plan` resolve against the bundled model catalog and `--resume` against on-disk sessions via a hidden `__complete` helper.
- Added a `/switch` slash command that opens the temporary model selector for the current session, mirroring the `alt+p` keybinding.
- Added `replace block N:` and `delete block N` operators to the `edit` tool: they resolve the syntactic block beginning on line N via tree-sitter (native `blockRangeAt`) and replace or delete its full line span, so a construct can be rewritten or removed without counting its closing line. Unresolvable blocks (unsupported language, blank/closing-delimiter line, or a parse error) are rejected with guidance to use an explicit `replace N..M:` / `delete N..M` range.
- Added an animated pending border for `bash` and `eval` execution blocks: while a command/cell is running, a single dark segment glides clockwise around the block's outer edge (top → right → bottom → left), replacing the previous static accent border. Motion is eased per edge (decelerating into each corner) and timed against a fixed lap duration mapped onto the live perimeter, so streaming a new output line or resizing the terminal nudges the segment proportionally instead of resetting its position. Driven by the existing spinner cadence and gated on the `display.shimmer` setting (no motion when `disabled`).
- Added `providers.tinyModelDevice` and `providers.tinyModelDtype` settings (Providers tab) controlling local tiny-model acceleration for session titles and Mnemopi memory tasks. `providers.tinyModelDevice` selects the ONNX execution provider (`default` keeps the platform pick — DirectML on Windows, CUDA on Linux x64, CPU elsewhere); `providers.tinyModelDtype` selects quantization/precision (`default` keeps each model's shipped `q4`, e.g. `fp16` trades speed for fidelity). The `PI_TINY_DEVICE` / `PI_TINY_DTYPE` env vars override the matching setting. Also added `PI_TINY_DTYPE` as the env counterpart to `PI_TINY_DEVICE`; an unrecognized device/precision fails loudly at worker startup instead of silently loading a different one.
- Added a bundled set of default rules shipped with the agent (TypeScript/Rust convention rules registered as TTSR conditions). They load via the new lowest-priority `builtin-defaults` discovery provider, so any user/project/tool rule of the same name overrides the bundled copy. Disable the whole set with `ttsr.builtinRules: false`, or drop individual rules (bundled or your own) by name via `ttsr.disabledRules`.

### Changed

- Changed setup onboarding to a tabbed `Set up your providers` scene with dedicated `Sign in` and `Web search` panels
- Changed the glyph mode picker to preselect the currently configured symbol preset instead of always defaulting to Unicode and to show live glyph samples in the picker rows
- Changed OAuth sign-in flow in the setup wizard so users can authenticate multiple providers before leaving with Escape
- Changed the plan-approval model-tier slider and the `ctrl+p`/`alt+p` role-cycle status to share one status-line-style chip track: each tier renders in its own role color and the active tier is filled as a powerline chip with a luminance-matched label. The role-cycle status now shows only the chip track — the resolved model and thinking level already live on the status line — instead of the verbose `Switched to <role>: <model> (cycle: …)` line.
- Changed the in-flight `bash` tool-call preview to render as a full bordered block as soon as the call appears, instead of a one-line `Bash: $ …` status that only expanded into a block once the command produced its first output chunk. Silent commands (e.g. `sleep 30`) now show the framed command block — with the animated pending border — for their whole runtime.
- Changed local tiny-model inference to request a worker-safe accelerated ONNX execution provider where available (DirectML on Windows, CUDA on Linux x64), with CPU retry if acceleration cannot initialize. `PI_TINY_DEVICE=cpu` restores CPU-only behavior; `PI_TINY_DEVICE=metal` is accepted as a WebGPU alias but guarded back to CPU in the production macOS worker because WebGPU currently hard-crashes Bun on worker teardown.

### Fixed

- Used the native block resolver for hashline operations so `replace block` edits now derive block ranges from file-aware parsing
- Fixed OAuth login handling to cancel cleanly when users press Esc or Ctrl+C during authentication
- Fixed the `read` tool description advertising `inspect_image` ("for visual analysis, call `inspect_image`") even when the `inspect_image` tool was disabled, which left the model hunting for a tool absent from its function list. The image section is now gated on `inspect_image.enabled`: when disabled it instead states that reading an image path returns the decoded image inline.
- Fixed session-title generation latching onto literal text inside fenced code blocks — a pasted UI mockup containing "Welcome to Claude Code v2.1.158" titled the session "Setup Screen for Claude Code v2.1.158" instead of capturing the actual request. The first user message now has fenced code blocks stripped before titling (both the online `pi/smol` and local on-device model paths share the same preprocessing), with a fallback to the original message when stripping would leave too little to title from (e.g. a message that is essentially just a code block).
- Fixed slash-command autocomplete repaint requests so Windows Terminal sessions with unknown native viewport state keep updating the input box and candidate list. ([#1550](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1550))
- Fixed Python `eval` failing the whole session when the managed `~/.omp/python-env` interpreter exists on disk but no longer runs (e.g. a stale `uv`-managed Python that was removed or upgraded). Availability resolution now enumerates every candidate — active/project venv, the managed env, then the system interpreter — and probes each in priority order, falling through to the first that actually executes instead of failing fast on the first resolved path. The kernel spawns whichever interpreter the probe selected, so a working system Python takes over transparently.

### Removed

- Removed the `recipe` tool and its `recipe.enabled` setting. Task-runner targets (just/package.json/Cargo/make/Taskfile) are invoked directly through `bash`.

## [15.6.0] - 2026-05-30
### Added

- Added prompt-mode autocomplete for supported internal URL schemes (`skill://`, `rule://`, `agent://`, `artifact://`, `local://`, `memory://`, and `omp://`) so typing those tokens now suggests existing resources as completion candidates
- Added fuzzy matching and ranked suggestion ordering for internal URL completion, including rule and skill descriptions, with accepted completion replacing just the typed token and inserting the chosen URL followed by a space
- Changed internal URL completions now include nested `local://` path suggestions from the configured local workspace
- Added Mnemopi memory inference model selection with an online mode or local transformers.js options (`qwen3-1.7b`, `gemma-3-1b`, `qwen2.5-1.5b`, `lfm2-1.2b`) so memory extraction and consolidation can run via the shared tiny-model worker
- Changed memory tiny-model handling to route local memory prompts through the same queueed tiny-model worker pipeline with bounded completion output
- Added a Providers → Tiny Model setting for session titles, defaulting to the online `pi/smol` path with five optional local CPU transformers.js models. A local model — and the one-time `@huggingface/transformers` runtime install in compiled binaries — is downloaded and loaded only when explicitly selected (or via `omp tiny-models download`); the default online path never spawns the title worker for inference. Selecting a local model adds a delayed `pi/smol` fallback so titles never block, plus in-chat download progress.
- Added a persistent live agent roster pinned below the editor (focus it with `Ctrl+S` or `Alt+Down`), including view-as switching into delegated agent sessions with human-readable delegate names and UI pinning to suppress idle reaping while viewed. The roster stays hidden until at least one delegated agent exists and releases focus back to the editor once the last one is gone.
- Recorded the originating session ID alongside each prompt in `history.db` (new `session_id` column, surfaced as `HistoryEntry.sessionId`), so recalled prompts can be traced back to the session they came from. Existing history databases gain the column automatically on next launch.
- Added compact inline TUI renderers for the `retain`, `recall`, and `reflect` memory tools. `retain` now shows one themed bullet line per stored item (truncated to width) under a status header with the stored/queued count, and `recall`/`reflect` collapse to a single query header (recall reports the match count and hides recalled memories until expanded) instead of dumping the raw JSON argument tree.
- Added a randomly picked tip beneath the welcome screen, sourced from an embedded `tips.txt` (one tip per line). The line is italicized with a purple `Tip:` label and a dimmed light-blue body, and the tip is chosen once per welcome instance so intro-animation and LSP re-renders don't shuffle it.
- Added a Mnemopi-only `memory_edit` agent tool for updating, forgetting, or invalidating recalled memories by id, and added `/memory stats` plus `/memory diagnose` slash commands for backend maintenance visibility.
- Added an `orchestrate` magic keyword that mirrors `ultrathink`: dropping the standalone word in a message paints it with a cool teal→violet gradient in the editor and appends a hidden system notice that switches the model into the multi-phase, parallel-subagent orchestration contract. Matching is word-bounded and case-insensitive, so `orchestrated`/`orchestrating` never trigger it.
- Added a model-tier slider to the plan-approval prompt ("Plan mode - next step"). Left/right arrows move it from any list position to pick which configured role model (`cycleOrder`, e.g. `smol › default › slow`) executes the approved plan, with each tier colored by its role and the resolved model name shown beneath the track. The chosen tier is applied before dispatch and carries through the fresh/compacted execution session; the slider is hidden when fewer than two role models resolve.

### Changed

- Changed `irc` to treat the attached human as a first-class `User` peer, merging human prompts into `irc call User` with optional structured question payloads and adding `/dm <agent> <message>` for user-to-agent routing without switching views.
- Changed the `--resume` session picker (and the in-session resume selector) to also rank sessions by prompt-history matches from `history.db`, not just the session-list metadata. Because the session list only indexes the first 4KB of each file, this surfaces sessions by prompts typed deep into long conversations. Sessions matched by both signals lead, then metadata-only matches, then history-only matches — no metadata match is dropped.
- Changed the `task` tool's streaming call preview to list each dispatched agent's `id` and UI description as a tree instead of a bare `N agents` count, so the individual agents are visible while the tool-call arguments are still streaming. The collapsed view caps at 12 entries (`… N more agents`); the expanded view shows all.
- Changed Mnemopi `recall` tool output to include memory ids for explicit recall results so agents can target `memory_edit`; auto-injected memory context and `reflect` remain id-free.
- Changed the system prompt to advertise `memory://root` only when the local memory backend is active.
- Changed `todo_write` result rendering to animate completed items in place: the checkbox flips checked first, then the strikethrough reveals across the task text.

### Removed

- Removed the standalone `ask`, `task`, and `yield` tools along with their obsolete prompts, docs, and tests; delegation now routes through persistent `delegate` agents plus IRC coordination.
- Removed the `/orchestrate` slash command; orchestration is now triggered by the `orchestrate` keyword (see Added) so the contract rides alongside the user's own prompt instead of replacing it.
- Removed the sticky Todos panel all-done drop/collapse animation; completed todo state now stays visible until the next explicit todo update changes it.

### Fixed

- Fixed Mnemopi session shutdown to flush queued memory extractions before exit so the last turn’s facts are not lost
- Fixed a native crash (`malloc: pointer being freed was not allocated` / `NAPI FATAL ERROR`) when quitting after the local transformers.js title model had run. The tiny-title worker no longer calls `pipeline.dispose()` on shutdown — disposing the onnxruntime session freed native memory that Bun's worker/NAPI teardown then freed again. The worker is torn down immediately after, so the OS reclaims the model memory regardless.
- Fixed the tiny-title download progress bar flashing on every first message even when the local model was already downloaded. A cached model emits the same `download`/`progress` events as a real download, so the bar is now revealed only when in-flight progress events keep arriving past a short grace window — cache hits finish (or fall silent during onnxruntime init) before then and never show the bar.
- Fixed the Mnemopi memory backend lifecycle so auto-retain counts the full session transcript, delegated agents inherit the parent Mnemopi state, `/memory clear` removes scoped project-bank databases, session disposal closes Mnemopi SQLite handles, session switches rekey/reset Mnemopi tracking, and project bank names include an absolute-root hash with safe bank-name sanitization.
- Fixed the streaming edit preview showing no diff for single-line hashline edits. The preview-diff coalescing keyed only on the arg text, so the final (args-complete) pass — which computes an untrimmed diff — was skipped because the payload was byte-identical to the last streamed chunk whose trailing line had been trimmed. The dedup key now pairs the streaming state with a content hash.
- Fixed `Esc` in a delegated agent view returning to the main session instead of aborting the delegated agent's active turn.
- Fixed the subagent stats line to separate the cost with the theme dot separator (was a stray literal `.`) and to render context usage as `<pct>%/<window>` (e.g. `21.3%/272K`) matching the status line gauge, via a shared `formatContextUsage` helper now used by the footer, status-line segment, session observer overlay, and `task` renderer.
- Fixed the agent roster staying pinned under the editor when all delegated agents are idle or dormant; it now reappears when explicitly focused with `Alt+Down` / session observe.
- Fixed selector-style UI components to honor `tui.select.up` and `tui.select.down` keybindings instead of hard-coding raw Up/Down arrow bytes ([#1535](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1535)).
- Fixed the bash (and `recipe`) tool result footer not rendering for failed commands. A non-zero exit threw a `ToolError`, which dropped the result details, so the styled `⟨Wall … | Timeout …⟩` footer was replaced by the raw `Wall time: … seconds` / `Command exited with code N` lines. Non-zero exits now resolve as a non-throwing error result that keeps `wallTimeMs`/`timeoutSeconds`/`exitCode`, and the footer shows `⟨Wall … | Timeout … | Exit: N⟩` with the textual notices folded out of the output pane. Aborts, timeouts, and missing-exit-status still throw as before.
- Fixed selector-style UI components to honor `tui.select.up` and `tui.select.down` keybindings instead of hard-coding raw Up/Down arrow bytes ([#1535](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1535)).

### Added

- `omp plugin install` now accepts GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket shorthand (`github:user/repo`, `gitlab:user/repo`, …) and full git URLs (`https://github.com/user/repo`, `git@github.com:user/repo`, …) in addition to npm specs and marketplace refs.
## [15.5.15] - 2026-05-30
### Changed

- Enabled the agent loop's tool-call batch cap for Anthropic Claude sessions, cutting oversized streamed tool-use bursts into runnable batches before continuing the conversation.

### Removed

- Removed the `calc` tool (deterministic arithmetic evaluator) and its `calc.enabled` setting. The model can compute via `eval` instead.

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic Claude tool-call batching to clear and reapply the Claude-specific batch cap whenever the session model changes

## [15.5.14] - 2026-05-29
### Added

- Added progress status output for `llm()` calls in `eval`, including the resolved model, tier, and returned character count
- Added an `llm(prompt, opts)` helper to both `eval` runtimes (JavaScript and Python) for oneshot, stateless LLM calls. `opts.model` selects a tier — `"smol"` (`pi/smol`), `"default"` (the session's active model, falling back to `pi/default`), or `"slow"` (`pi/slow`, with high reasoning effort on reasoning-capable models). Pass `system` for a system prompt and a plain JSON-Schema `schema` to force a structured response (the helper returns the parsed object instead of the completion string). Calls carry no conversation history and expose no agent-visible tools; they route host-side through the existing tool bridge under the reserved name `__llm__` (`packages/coding-agent/src/eval/llm-bridge.ts`).

### Fixed

- Fixed a rewind/restore loop (and a follow-on handoff failure) caused by assistant turns whose tool results are off the resolved conversation path — e.g. selecting such a turn in `/tree`, restoring a session whose head is a mid-batch turn, or branching a new message in right after a turn whose tool calls hadn't resolved on that branch. `buildSessionContext` walks the leaf→root path, so any turn whose `tool_result` children live on a sibling branch (or below the leaf) ends up with **dangling** `tool_use` blocks. `transformMessages` then fabricated one synthetic `"aborted"`/`"No result provided"` result per dangling call plus a `<turn-aborted>` developer note, which both rendered as phantom failed calls on a turn that "hadn't run anything yet" and re-injected the failed batch into the model's context, prompting it to re-issue the batch (the spiral). `buildSessionContext` now rewrites **every** assistant turn on the resolved path that has dangling `tool_use`: it drops the unpaired `tool_use` blocks, drops `redacted_thinking` blocks, and clears `thinking` signatures (the provider encoder then emits them as plain text), dropping a turn entirely if no content remains. Turns whose tool calls *are* paired on the path are left untouched. Stripping the calls alone was insufficient — a *modified* assistant turn that still carried signed `thinking`/`redacted_thinking` was rejected by Anthropic with `messages.N.content.M: 'thinking' or 'redacted_thinking' blocks in the latest assistant message cannot be modified`, which surfaced as `Handoff generation failed: 400` on navigation. Live turns are unaffected — their results persist on the same path before any context rebuild.

- Fixed external extension loading on Windows compiled binaries: bare `@oh-my-pi/pi-*` value imports (e.g. `import { AssistantMessageEventStream } from "@oh-my-pi/pi-ai"`) failed with `Cannot find package '\$bunfs\root\packages\…'` because `legacy-pi-compat.ts` built shim override paths from a hardcoded POSIX `/$bunfs/root/packages` literal. Win32 normalised the leading slash to a backslash and the resulting path never resolved against the real bunfs mount (`<drive>:\~BUN\root\…`). The bunfs package root is now derived from `import.meta.dir`, so override paths stay platform-native on Windows, Linux, and macOS ([#1514](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1514)).
- Fixed the interactive prompt showing no cursor in Ghostty. A prior change wired the editor's cursor mode to a new `getUseTerminalCursorMarker()` (which always reported the *requested* preference) instead of the resolved hardware-cursor visibility, so when Ghostty force-hid the hardware cursor the editor stayed in terminal-cursor (marker-only) mode and drew no glyph — leaving no visible caret with either `showHardwareCursor`/`PI_HARDWARE_CURSOR` value. The editor now follows `ui.getShowHardwareCursor()`: a hidden hardware cursor falls back to the steady software-cursor glyph (which still emits `CURSOR_MARKER` for IME positioning).

### Changed

- Changed the `eval` tool's `display()` JSON tree in the transcript to use the shared `renderJsonTreeLines` renderer (the same one behind tool args, MCP results, and subagent output) instead of its own format. This drops the redundant `Object(N)` / `Array(N)` type labels and the per-output `JSON output N` header in favor of type icons plus bare keys; the `display[N]` header is now shown only when a cell emits more than one `display()` value.
- Reverted the sticky `Todos` panel task glyphs to the pre-15.5.12 checkbox icons: completed tasks render `theme.checkbox.checked` (not `theme.status.success`) and in-progress tasks render `theme.checkbox.unchecked` (not the running glyph). Removed the animated spinner entirely — in-progress tasks and pending tasks with a matching in-flight subagent still highlight via the `accent` colour, but the panel now paints once per state change instead of on an 80 ms timer. Subagent auto-checkmarking, the advancing window (`selectStickyTodoWindow`), `todoMatchesAnyDescription` highlighting, and the all-done close animation are unchanged.

## [15.5.13] - 2026-05-29
### Breaking Changes

- Changed hashline edit syntax to verb-based v4: body-bearing ops are `replace N..M:`, `insert before N:`, `insert after N:`, `insert head:`, and `insert tail:`, while bodyless `delete N..M` handles deletion. Removed `>A..B` repeat rows and the old `prepend:` / `append:` virtual insert headers; `-` rows remain rejected with a teaching error.

### Changed

- Changed hashline tag generation to use full-file snapshots for read/search/ast-grep and related outputs, so hashline anchors now validate only when the complete file matches
- Changed hashline tagging to omit file headers for files over 4 MiB or that cannot be snapshotted, so those files are returned without editable hashline anchors
- Changed hashline context generation for line edits from partial/sparse snippets to complete-file fingerprints, reducing stale anchors for partially read files

### Fixed

- Restored automatic repair of `edit` range hunks that break bracket balance — the failure class that previously left a duplicated closing line (a `</>` / `);` / `}` echoed just below the range) or dropped one (the range swallowed a `});` the payload never restated), leaving the file syntactically broken until a follow-up edit. The hashline applier now normalizes each replacement so its payload preserves the deleted region's delimiter balance, dropping a duplicated bordering closer or sparing a deleted one, and surfaces a warning on the tool result. Always on and balance-validated (no `edit.hashlineAutoDropPureInsertDuplicates` setting); see `@oh-my-pi/hashline` for the contract.

## [15.5.12] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- Added the `omp-plugins` discovery provider, which scans every extension package directory configured via `extensions:` (in `~/.omp/agent/settings.json` or `<cwd>/.omp/settings.json`) or `--extension`/`-e` on the CLI for `skills/`, `hooks/pre|post/`, `tools/`, `commands/`, `rules/`, `prompts/`, and `.mcp.json`. Prior to this, only the extension's TypeScript factory module ran; every sibling capability the docs (https://omp.sh/docs/extension-authoring) advertised was silently ignored ([#1496](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1496)).
- Added the top-level `omp install <target>` subcommand documented at https://omp.sh/docs/extension-authoring. Local paths route to `omp plugin link` (so the directory is symlinked into the plugin set), and npm/marketplace specs route to `omp plugin install`. Before this, `install` was not a registered subcommand and the CLI runner silently forwarded `install ./my-extension` to `launch` as an initial LLM prompt ([#1496](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1496)).

### Changed

- Changed the sticky `Todos` panel above the editor to advance as tasks close, instead of pinning to the first 5 tasks of the active phase. `selectStickyTodoWindow` now shows up to 5 open (pending / in_progress) tasks in original phase order and reports the count of remaining open tasks for the `+N more` hint, so every `todo_write` flip produces a visible row shift. Closed-phase tail falls back to the last 5 tasks (with the `+N more` line suppressed) until `getActivePhase` walks to the next phase.
- Linked the sticky `Todos` panel to the live `SessionObserverRegistry` so pending todos that have an in-flight subagent doing their work light up green with an animated spinner — the same `theme.spinnerFrames` ("status" preset) the `task` tool uses for its agent rows — instead of staying greyed out as if nothing is happening. A new exported `todoMatchesAnyDescription(content, descriptions)` does case- and whitespace-insensitive equality first with a 6-char minimum-overlap substring fallback in either direction, so "Sonnet #2: shallow bug scan" and a subagent description of "Sonnet #2" still link up. Completed todos now render with `theme.status.success` (✔ / `\uf00c` / `[ok]` per symbol preset, still wrapped in the `success` colour so themed palettes can keep their purple/green/whatever) and in_progress rows render with `theme.status.running`, matching the `task` tool's icon vocabulary. The spinner interval only ticks while at least one visible open todo has a matched active subagent, and self-stops once subagents finish, so plain in_progress todos do not animate forever in the absence of subagent activity.
- Extracted the top-level CLI command table from `src/cli.ts` into a side-effect-free `src/cli-commands.ts` so test code can introspect the registered subcommands without triggering the entrypoint's top-level await.

## [15.5.11] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- Added `SqlSessionStorage`, a `bun:sql`-backed implementation of `SessionStorage` that persists session JSONL into PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, or SQLite. Pass a connected `Bun.SQL` instance (the constructor accepts `postgres://`, `mysql://`, or `sqlite:` URLs) to `SqlSessionStorage.create({ client, table?, adapter?, createTable? })` and hand the returned storage to any `SessionManager` factory. The dialect is auto-detected from `client.options.adapter` and used to pick the correct DDL plus upsert-with-append syntax (`ON CONFLICT … DO UPDATE` for PG/SQLite, `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` for MySQL), so the agent's append-only persist pattern works in a single round-trip per line. Same in-memory mirror and `drain()` semantics as the Redis backend; blobs and tool artifacts still live on disk via `ArtifactManager`/`BlobStore`.
- Added `RedisSessionStorage`, a `bun:redis`-backed implementation of the `SessionStorage` interface that lets API consumers route session JSONL through Redis instead of local disk. Pass a connected `Bun.RedisClient` (or any compatible adapter) to `RedisSessionStorage.create({ client, prefix? })` and hand the returned storage to `SessionManager.create(cwd, sessionDir, storage)` (or any other static factory that accepts a storage argument). An in-memory mirror is loaded on creation so the interface's synchronous methods (`existsSync`, `statSync`, `listFilesSync`, …) keep their contracts; `drain()` waits for queued background writes. Tool artifacts and image blobs still live on disk via `ArtifactManager`/`BlobStore` — Redis only owns the session JSONL keyspace under the configured prefix.
- Exported the `SessionStorage` / `SessionStorageWriter` / `FileSessionStorage` / `MemorySessionStorage` symbols (already reachable via the `./session/session-storage` subpath) from the package root so SDK consumers can construct alternative storage backends without deep-importing.
- Added a fresh `¶<relative-path>#TAG` snapshot header to the `write` tool's success text in hashline display mode, covering plain disk writes, ACP-bridge writes, and conflict resolutions (bulk resolutions emit a trailing `Snapshots:` block with one header per successfully written file). The header records a current snapshot in the file-snapshot store so the next `edit` can land without an extra `read` round-trip. Suppressed when the session is not in hashline mode and skipped for archive/SQLite writes and host-managed internal URL targets where hashline anchors do not apply.

### Changed

- The `edit` tool's stale-snapshot rejection message now distinguishes "file changed between read and edit" (the section's hash was recorded in this session but the file has since drifted — a prior in-session edit advanced it, or an external write changed it) from "hash #X is not from this session" (a fabricated or carried-over cross-session tag), the latter carrying explicit "never invent the tag" guidance. Both messages include the current file hash plus 2 lines of context around each anchor so the next attempt has everything it needs. Snapshot-based recovery still runs first; the sharper diagnostics only surface when recovery cannot reconcile the edit.

### Fixed

- Fixed Autonomous Memory phase 1/phase 2 failing with `Thinking effort low is not supported by <provider>/<model>` on models whose supported reasoning efforts exclude `low`/`medium` (e.g. `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`). Both stage1 (`Effort.Low`) and consolidation (`Effort.Medium`) call sites in `packages/coding-agent/src/memories/index.ts` now route through `clampThinkingLevelForModel`, lifting the requested effort to the model's lowest supported level instead of letting `requireSupportedEffort` throw ([#1480](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1480)).

## [15.5.10] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- Added `/drop-images` slash command that strips every `ImageContent` block from the current session's branch — `user`/`developer`/`custom`/`hookMessage`/`toolResult` content arrays plus `toolResult.details.images` and `fileMention.files[].image` — rewrites the session JSONL, rebuilds the agent's in-memory message list, tears down Codex Responses provider sessions, and rebuilds the TUI chat container so the change is visible immediately. ACP clients receive the same handler (returns `"Dropped N images …"` / `"No images found …"` through `runtime.output`). Stripping content that would leave a `toolResult` or `user` message with zero blocks inserts a single `[image removed]` placeholder so providers do not reject empty content arrays.

### Fixed

- Fixed compaction surfacing raw HTTP 401/403 envelopes (e.g. `Compaction failed: 401 {"type":"error","error":{"type":"authentication_error",…}}`) instead of routing to an authenticated fallback model. The compaction layer now attaches the provider-reported HTTP status onto the thrown error, and `AgentSession`'s auth-failure detector branches on `error.status === 401 || 403` in addition to the existing `auth_unavailable` regex. When a fallback model role (e.g. `modelRoles.smol`) is configured, compaction retries it transparently; otherwise the user sees the actionable "Compaction requires usable credentials for …" hint instead of the raw provider envelope.

### Fixed

- Fixed compiled-binary legacy plugin loading for `@earendil-works/*` imports of bundled package roots such as `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`; compat now rewrites all bundled pi package roots to bunfs entrypoints and resolves fallback peer dependencies through the canonical `@oh-my-pi/*` specifier.

## [15.5.8] - 2026-05-28

### Breaking Changes

- Changed hashline edit parsing to require wrapped hunk headers such as `@@ A..B @@` (including `@@ BOF @@` and `@@ EOF @@`), with empty `@@ A..B @@` blocks deleting the anchored range and legacy inline payload forms treated as malformed

### Added

- Added `vault.enabled` setting (Tools → Obsidian Vault, default `false`) gating the `vault://` internal URL. When disabled, `VaultProtocolHandler.resolve` / `write`, `resolveVaultUrlToPath`, and `hasObsidian()` all refuse — the latter hides the `vault://` entry from the system prompt's Handlebars `{{#if hasObsidian}}` block. Tests can opt in via `vi.spyOn(vaultProtocol, "isVaultEnabled").mockReturnValue(true)`.

- Added support for `vault://` URLs in path resolution utilities, including plan mode and internal selector parsing so `read` and edit paths can target Obsidian vault files directly
- Added `vault://` internal URLs for editable Obsidian vault files, with filesystem-backed read/write/listing and CLI-backed vault index operations.
- Added strict-mode indicators to `omp auth-gateway check` output by appending `[strict]` to strict-mode text headers and adding a top-level `strict` field in `--json` output
- `omp auth-gateway check --strict` exercises each broker-supplied credential against its provider's chat-completion endpoint (cheapest bundled chat model per provider, with 15s/attempt timeout and up to 4 catalog fall-throughs on "model not found / invalid model" errors). Surfaces failures where the usage endpoint reports 200 but the chat endpoint 401s the same bearer (revoked OAuth scope, mislabeled provider row, …). Output gains a `[chat: ok|FAIL|skip]` column in text mode and a `completion` field on each credential in `--json` mode; the chat-failed count contributes to the non-zero exit code.

### Changed

- Changed hashline apply behavior to preserve duplicated boundary and context lines in replacement and insert payloads instead of auto-absorbing or dropping them
- Updated hashline syntax: replaced `↑`/`↓` payload sigils with `^` repeat syntax and `|` literal rows for clearer edit semantics
- Changed hashline delete syntax from bare `A:` or `A-B:` to explicit `A-B:-` inline delete marker
- Modified hashline anchor syntax to require explicit range notation `A-B:` instead of shorthand `A:` for single-line operations
- Updated hashline description in settings to clarify pure insert context behavior without arrow notation

### Removed

- Removed the `edit.hashlineAutoDropPureInsertDuplicates` setting
- Removed the `edit.hashlineAutoDropPureInsertDuplicates` setting from configuration and execution paths
- Removed the `edit.hashlineAutoDropPureInsertDuplicates` setting
- Removed the `edit.hashlineAutoDropPureInsertDuplicates` setting from configuration and execution paths

### Fixed

- Fixed agent yielding silently on `response.incomplete` (OpenAI Responses / Codex `stopReason: "length"`). The agent now treats output-side incompletion as a recovery case: drops the truncated/reasoning-only assistant turn, attempts context promotion to a larger model, and falls back to compaction or handoff. `AutoCompactionStartEvent.reason` and the custom-tool `auto_compaction_start.trigger` discriminator gain an `"incomplete"` value. The handoff strategy is honored for `"incomplete"` (unlike `"overflow"`, where the input is broken and handoff would hit the same wall).
- Fixed `eval` tool to resize large displayed images and append dimension notes to text output
- Fixed `write` tool to strip malformed or loose hashline section headers before writing file content
- Fixed `eval` tool image rendering to resize displayed images before returning them and append image-dimension notes to text output
- Fixed `write` tool output sanitation to strip malformed or loose hashline section headers before writing file content
- Fixed `omp auth-broker serve` crashing at startup with `logger.setTransports is not a function` — switched the call site to `import { setTransports } from "@oh-my-pi/pi-utils/logger"`, bypassing the `logger` namespace re-export that some Bun versions failed to expose at runtime
- Fixed `omp auth-gateway` returning `502 upstream_error` and refusing to rotate credentials when a provider responded with a non-401 usage-limit error (Codex `usage_limit_reached`, Anthropic `usage_limit_reached`, Google `resource_exhausted`). `classifyGatewayError` now reuses `pi-ai`'s central `isUsageLimitError` heuristic and reports those failures as `429 rate_limit_error`. `streamSimple`'s pre-emit retry hook fires on usage-limit phrasing in addition to HTTP 401; the gateway's refresh callback branches on the error type and calls `AuthStorage.markUsageLimitReached(provider, sessionId, { retryAfterMs })` — temporarily blocking just the exhausted credential and surfacing the next sibling — instead of `invalidateCredentialMatching`, which would have suspect/deleted the row. The same branching is wired into the coding-agent `streamFn` callback so subscription multi-account rotation works the same on both surfaces.
- Fixed `extractRetryHint` not recognising Codex's `Try again in ~N min.` / `… hour` / `… hours` phrasing, which left the gateway and TUI without a server-suggested retry window when an upstream account hit its usage cap. The shared `try again in` pattern now accepts `min`, `minutes`, `mins`, `h`, `hr`, `hour`, `hours` units in addition to `ms` / `s` / `sec`, and tolerates a leading `~` and embedded whitespace.
- Fixed the auth-gateway threading `sessionId: undefined` into `AuthStorage.getApiKey`, which left `#sessionLastCredential` empty and made `markUsageLimitReached` a no-op for gateway-mediated requests. Both `/v1/chat/completions`-style endpoints and the `/v1/pi/stream` fast path now derive a stable `sessionId` from the client's `prompt_cache_key` (or the existing model+system+tools+first-message hash when absent) and reuse the same identity for credential-stickiness and prefix-cache routing.
- Fixed `eval` tool to resize large displayed images and append dimension notes to text output
- Fixed `write` tool to strip malformed or loose hashline section headers before writing file content
- Fixed `eval` tool image rendering to resize displayed images before returning them and append image-dimension notes to text output
- Fixed `write` tool output sanitation to strip malformed or loose hashline section headers before writing file content
- Fixed `omp auth-broker serve` crashing at startup with `logger.setTransports is not a function` — switched the call site to `import { setTransports } from "@oh-my-pi/pi-utils/logger"`, bypassing the `logger` namespace re-export that some Bun versions failed to expose at runtime
- Fixed user shortcut Python execution to namespace session IDs like eval, so both paths share one kernel

### Security

- Secured `vault://` reads and writes by validating URL paths and blocking traversal, absolute paths, and symlink escapes outside the selected vault root

## [15.5.7] - 2026-05-27
### Added
- `providers.openrouterVariant` setting (Settings → Providers → "OpenRouter Routing") to default OpenRouter requests to a routing-variant suffix (`:nitro`, `:floor`, `:online`, `:exacto`). Selectors that already name a variant (e.g. `openrouter/anthropic/claude-haiku:nitro`) keep precedence.

- `generate_image` supports xAI Grok Imagine via `providers.image=xai`. Supports `grok-imagine-image` (default) and `grok-imagine-image-quality` at aspect ratios `1:1`, `16:9`, `9:16`, `4:3`, `3:4`, `3:2`, `2:3`. Uses the xAI Grok OAuth credential when available, otherwise `XAI_API_KEY`.
- New `tts` tool synthesises speech via xAI Grok Voice behind the disabled-by-default `tts.enabled` setting. Built-in voices `ara`, `eve` (default), `leo`, `rex`, `sal`; custom voice IDs also accepted. Output codec inferred from the `output_path` suffix (`.wav` → `wav`, else `mp3`). Up to 15,000 characters per request.

### Fixed

- Fixed plan-mode re-entry after approval reopening a fresh `local://PLAN.md` instead of the approved titled plan artifact, which could duplicate plan content and fail approval on an existing destination.
- Fixed `read` URL reader mode aborting after a stalled Jina request instead of falling back to trafilatura/lynx/native: Jina (and Parallel extract) now have their own per-attempt sub-budget capped at 10s, the catch handler honours only real user cancellation, and the in-process native renderer is always attempted on already-loaded HTML ([#1449](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1449))

## [15.5.6] - 2026-05-27
### Added

- Support for multi-range line selectors on URLs (e.g., `:5-10,20-30`) to fetch and display multiple non-contiguous sections
- Support for combining `:raw` mode with line range selectors on URLs (e.g., `:raw:1-120` or `:1-120:raw`)
- Support for line range selectors on directory listings (e.g., `:30-40` to view lines 30–40 of a directory tree)
- Clear error message when requesting a line offset beyond the end of a directory listing

### Changed

- URL selector parsing now supports multiple trailing selector tokens (e.g., `:raw:N-M`), applying them left-to-right

### Fixed

- Fixed `:raw` selector being ignored for JSON and feed URLs, causing them to be pretty-printed or converted to markdown instead of returning raw content
- Fixed directory listing line selectors silently dropping the offset parameter and only applying the limit

## [15.5.5] - 2026-05-27

### Changed

- Removed the model-facing `path` property from hashline edit tool parameters; hashline edit targets now come from `¶PATH` headers in `input`.

### Fixed

- Fixed legacy pi-* extension loading regression where `import { Type } from "@(scope)/pi-ai"` (e.g. `@earendil-works/pi-ai` used by `@plannotator/pi-extension`) failed with `Export named 'Type' not found` after pi-ai 15.1.0 removed the root `Type` runtime export; the legacy-pi compat layer now redirects bare `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai` root imports through a sibling shim that re-exports the canonical pi-ai surface plus the Zod-backed `Type` runtime from the same TypeBox shim served to `@sinclair/typebox` imports ([#1437](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1437))

## [15.5.4] - 2026-05-27

### Breaking Changes
- Removed the package root `hashline` export so imports from the top-level entrypoint can no longer access `hashline` helpers directly

### Added

- Added `read.summarize.minTotalLines` setting (default 100) to set the minimum file length that triggers read summarization
- Added `<file>:<lines>` support to `search` `paths`, allowing file-scoped constraints such as `:N-M`, `:N+K`, and comma-separated ranges
- Added `ModelRegistry.create(authStorage, modelsPath?)` async factory that runs the JSON → YAML migration step on `models.{yml,yaml}` asynchronously ahead of the sync constructor's bundled-model load. The sync `new ModelRegistry(...)` constructor still works (tests rely on it); production boot paths now use the factory so the migration's I/O lands off the event-loop hot path.
- Added `ConfigFile.tryLoadAsync()`, `ConfigFile.loadAsync()`, `ConfigFile.loadOrDefaultAsync()`, `ConfigFile.getMtimeMsAsync()`, and `ConfigFile.warmup(file)` so the rest of the codebase can migrate config reads off the sync path.

### Changed

- Changed multi-section hashline `edit` execution to defer LSP diagnostics flushing until the final section is written
- Changed read to return verbatim contents for files shorter than `read.summarize.minTotalLines` instead of summarizing them
- Changed `search` path line-range filtering to include only matches and context lines that fall inside the requested ranges
- Changed `MemorySessionStorage`'s mirror to a chunks-based representation. `writeLineSync` now appends to a `string[]` in O(1) (previously read the whole file and concatenated, giving O(N²) growth per session). `statSync` reports true UTF-8 byte length instead of character count. `readTextPrefix` walks chunks until the byte budget is exhausted instead of materialising the full mirror.
- Changed `ToolExecutionComponent.updateArgs` to drop the per-delta `structuredClone` of streaming tool arguments. Callers (`event-controller.ts`, `ui-helpers.ts`) already spread their input into a fresh object on each delta, so cloning here was dead work on the rendering hot path. Added a reference-equality short-circuit so repeat calls with the same args object skip the preview-diff and display refresh.
- Changed `ConfigFile`'s constructor to defer the JSON → YAML migration until first `tryLoad`/`tryLoadAsync` and to cache (jsonPath, ymlPath) pairs already migrated this process, so `relocate()` / repeated loads do not re-run the migration.
- Changed all production `new ModelRegistry(...)` call sites (`main.ts`, `sdk.ts`, `task/executor.ts`, `commit/pipeline.ts`, `commit/agentic/index.ts`, the SDK example) to `await ModelRegistry.create(...)`.

### Fixed

- Fixed a race in `withFileLock` where a contender losing the `mkdir` race could wipe the winner's freshly-created lock directory before the winner finished writing its info file. Every lock now carries a per-process UUID token; `releaseLock(path, expectedToken)` verifies ownership before `fs.rm`, and `isLockStale` no longer returns `true` for a dir whose info file is absent but whose mtime is still inside the staleness window (or whose dir vanished mid-check).
- Fixed `formatErrorMessage` not sanitising tabs or truncating oversized error strings before painting them through the theme. Errors that embedded raw file content (apply_patch failures, hashline mismatches, etc.) could break terminal alignment via raw `\t` chars or overflow the line width.

### Fixed

- Fixed multi-section hashline edits to reject duplicate canonical targets and preflight write guards before any section is committed

### Fixed

- Fixed `createAgentSession()` dropping the hidden `resolve` tool from the registry when no active tool sets `deferrable: true`, even though plan mode dispatches the plan-approval `resolve { action: "apply", ... }` call through a standing handler. Read-only plan-mode toolsets (e.g. `read`, `search`, `find`, `web_search`) silently activated plan mode without `resolve`, leaving the agent unable to submit the finalized plan and forcing the user to exit plan mode manually. `resolve` is now kept whenever `plan.enabled` is true, so the standing handler always has a callable tool ([#1428](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1428))

### Fixed

- Fixed `omp` startup and `/changelog` reading the host project's `CHANGELOG.md` as omp's — `getPackageDir()` no longer falls back to the user's `cwd` when no owning `package.json` is locatable, preventing spurious `lastChangelogVersion` writes ([#1423](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1423))

### Fixed

- Fixed hashline session-chain replay silently overwriting in-session edits when the model re-targeted a previously rewritten line with a stale file hash; replay now refuses unless every edit's anchor line content matches between the snapshot and the current file ([#1422](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/1422))

## [15.5.3] - 2026-05-27
### Breaking Changes

- Disallowed inline payload on hashline `↑`, `↓`, and `:` operations (including BOF/EOF inserts), requiring payload text to be supplied on standalone `+` continuation rows

### Changed

- Warned when legacy inline `LINE:TEXT` lines are accepted as payload continuations only when inside a pending multi-line `A-B:` replacement

### Fixed

- Fixed runtime model registry refresh and cache loading so providers with authoritative dynamic catalogs, including Synthetic, do not re-add deprecated bundled model IDs after discovery ([#1417](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1417)).

## [15.5.2] - 2026-05-26
### Breaking Changes

- Changed the hashline patch format so payload continuation lines now require a leading `+`, rejecting unprefixed multiline payload rows that were previously accepted as fallback payload text

### Changed

- Changed hashline payload parsing so blank lines are only preserved when prefixed with `+`, so blank separator lines between operations are ignored unless explicitly marked
- Changed payload escaping so a line beginning with `+` is now represented as `++...` while the leading marker is stripped before writing
- Changed the default `task.simple` mode from `default` to `schema-free`, so task-call `schema` inputs are disabled by default while shared `context` and user prompt/session-defined output schemas remain available
- Changed `tools.approvalMode: yolo` to auto-approve tool calls even when a tool marks `override: true`; user `tools.approval.<tool>` policies (`allow`/`prompt`/`deny`) now remain the only controls for yolo mode.
- Changed the hashline edit executor to coalesce two consecutive `A-B:` ops on the identical range last-wins (the model painted a before/after pair) and append a warning, instead of throwing `anchor line X is already targeted by the :/! op on line Y`. Other overlap shapes (different ranges, `A-B:`+`!`, `!`+`!`) still throw.

### Fixed

- Fixed nested replace parsing so line-anchored `N:` rows inside a pending `A-B:` replacement now trigger overlap errors instead of being silently folded into the replacement payload

## [15.5.1] - 2026-05-26

### Breaking Changes

- Removed the `href`, `hrefr`, and `hline` Handlebars prompt helpers along with the shared hashline anchor state; none were referenced by any built-in or user prompt template

## [15.5.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Added per-tool approval declarations so each built-in, custom, or extension tool can declare its capability tier and approval prompt details.
- Added `OMP_MCP_TIMEOUT_MS` environment variable to override MCP client request timeout for every server (in milliseconds); set to `0` to disable client-side timeouts. Invalid (negative or non-numeric) values are ignored with a warning and fall back to the per-server timeout or default 30s ([#1415](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/1415)).
- Added `omp auth-broker list` (with `--json` for machine-readable output) to enumerate supported OAuth providers, replacing `bunx @oh-my-pi/pi-ai list`.
- Added interactive provider selection to `omp auth-broker login` and `omp auth-broker logout` when invoked without a provider argument (replacing the equivalent `bunx @oh-my-pi/pi-ai login`/`logout` flows). The logout picker is sourced from stored credentials so it only lists providers the user is actually signed in to.
- Added directory matches to the `find` tool: glob searches now return directories alongside files, with directory hits emitted with a trailing `/` marker. `find` for `**/tests` no longer requires a follow-up `read` to surface a directory hit; tool prompt and output docs were updated to reflect that paths may be either kind.
- Added the RFC 8414 §3.1 path-ful issuer form (`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server<issuer-path>`) as a third candidate in MCP OAuth discovery, after origin-root and path-prefixed well-known URLs, so deployments that publish authorization-server metadata at the path-ful location resolve correctly. Single-segment authorization URLs (e.g. `https://gateway/my-service`) are now treated as the gateway prefix instead of being dropped back to the origin root.

### Changed

- Changed tool-approval prompts to use an explicit `Approve`/`Deny` selector and surface the denial reason as contextual help text instead of a bare confirm/cancel toggle.
- Changed approval safety overrides to prompt even in `yolo` / `--auto-approve` sessions, so critical tool-declared patterns no longer run unattended.
- Changed `omp auth-broker login` to drive the per-provider OAuth/API-key flow in-process via `AuthStorage.login()` instead of spawning the `pi-ai` CLI subprocess. The `pi-ai` bin is being removed; the same login surface now lives entirely inside `omp`.
- Changed the default per-line truncation cap for search/grep output (`DEFAULT_MAX_COLUMN`) from `1024` to `512` characters to keep wide minified single-line bundles from blowing out the model's context.
- Changed `edit.hashlineAutoDropPureInsertDuplicates` to also fire on `A-B:payload` replacement ops when a single non-structural boundary payload line duplicates the line immediately above the deleted range (prefix) or immediately below it (suffix). Catches the common mistake of `A-B:foo` where the user meant `A-B!` but typed a payload that happens to match adjacent context. The existing 2+-line block absorb and balance-validated structural single-line absorb already covered the multi-line and structural-delimiter cases; this closes the single-line non-structural gap.

### Fixed

- Fixed the agent loop and bash executor busy-spinning when scheduler waits returned early. napi `uv_async_send` callbacks can wake the event loop after only ~1–2 ms even when the caller asked for a longer sleep, so `yieldIfDue()` now compensates by retrying `Bun.sleep()` until the requested wall-clock duration has elapsed, and the bash executor wraps its `runPromise`/timeout/abort race in an `ExponentialYield` (20 ms → 10 s) so long-running commands stop hot-looping on the race. Yields are additionally throttled by a module-level 50 ms gate, and losing timers in the race are aborted via `AbortSignal` so they don't keep firing after a winner is selected ([#1396](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/1396) by [@hezhiyang2000](https://github.com/hezhiyang2000), closes [#1384](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1384)).
- Fixed streaming edit previews going blank for inline-payload ops. `LINE↓payload` / `A-B:payload` are valid single-line writes, but the natural-order preview was skipping the entire op token until a newline arrived — so the first character the model typed after the sigil only appeared after the next line ended, and the renderer would fall back to rendering the raw `A-B: bla bla bla` input. Inline-body content on `op-insert` and `op-replace` tokens is now emitted as a `+payload` line on the same op tick.
- Fixed `/usage` and the status-line reset countdown rendering stale negative deltas after a Codex window had elapsed: Codex keeps reporting the prior window's `reset_at` until a new request opens a fresh window, which turned the `resets in …` suffix into a meaningless negative duration. `formatDuration` now clamps non-positive, NaN, and infinite inputs to `0ms`, and both renderers suppress the `resets in …` suffix entirely once `resetsAt <= now`.
- Fixed auto-handoff race at the context threshold: when `compaction.strategy = handoff` fired at `agent_end` with an active checkpoint or incomplete todos, the deferred handoff post-prompt task and the rewind/todo-completion path both scheduled work concurrently, so a fresh `agent.continue()` streamed a new assistant turn alongside the handoff LLM call (visible as the "Auto-handoff" loader plus an assistant message still streaming, with the chat container then rebuilt mid-stream). `#checkCompaction` now reports whether it deferred a handoff and the `agent_end` handler short-circuits the rewind/todo passes; `#scheduleAgentContinue` also skips when `isCompacting || isGeneratingHandoff`. The pre-prompt `#checkCompaction` call now forces inline execution (`allowDefer = false`) so the new turn cannot begin until the maintenance settles.
- Fixed `/exit` and Ctrl+C-double-tap hanging when a deferred handoff was mid-flight: `AgentSession.dispose()` now aborts retry/compaction (auto-compaction + handoff) and the agent stream before draining `#cancelPostPromptTasks`, so the post-prompt task awaiting `generateHandoff` rejects and `Promise.allSettled` can resolve. Tool work (bash/eval/python) is intentionally still left for the existing dispose paths so shared kernels continue to survive across session dispose.

## [15.4.3] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- Fixed Google Vertex cached project discovery replacing the bundled fallback catalog so `/models` does not keep showing outdated Gemini entries after authoritative Vertex discovery, while keeping the bundled fallback in place when the cached snapshot is stale or non-authoritative (e.g. after an ADC discovery failure) ([#1412](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1412)).

## [15.4.2] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- Fixed plan-mode subagents being unable to terminate because `yield` was registered but missing from the active tool set when `requireYieldTool` was combined with an explicit `toolNames` list ([#1408](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1408))

## [15.4.1] - 2026-05-26

### Breaking Changes
- The `vim` edit mode option is no longer available; configurations using `edit.mode: vim` will be automatically mapped to `hashline` mode
- Hashline payload semantics are now strictly inline-first: the first payload line is whatever follows the sigil on the op line itself, and subsequent lines append after it. A newline immediately after `↑`/`↓`/`:` is no longer a free separator — it produces a blank first payload line. Use `LINE↓content` for a one-line insert, `LINE↓firstline\nsecondline` for two lines; bare `LINE↓` / `LINE↑` / `LINE:` (no inline payload) still insert/replace with one blank line as before.

### Added
- Added `irc.timeoutMs` setting to configure IRC message timeout duration with a default of 120 seconds
- Added timeout enforcement for IRC send operations to prevent indefinite hangs when recipients are unresponsive
- Added evaluator state inheritance for `task`-spawned subagents so JavaScript and Python variables are visible between a parent agent and its child sessions
- Added `hashline-per` edit mode to restore the legacy per-line hashline dialect alongside the default file-hash dialect
- Added file-hash computation and validation for hashline sections to detect stale edits
- Added file-read snapshot caching with multi-snapshot ring per path for recovery from agent's own writes
- Added delete operation (`!`) support to hashline grammar for explicit line deletion
- Added structural bracket/brace balance warnings when deleting lines with unclosed constructs
- Added file-hash computation and validation for hashline sections to detect stale edits
- Added file-read snapshot caching with multi-snapshot ring per path for recovery from agent's own writes
- Added delete operation (`!`) support to hashline grammar for explicit line deletion
- Added structural bracket/brace balance warnings when deleting lines with unclosed constructs
- Added resource metadata URL (RFC 9728) support to OAuth discovery for chaining authorization server resolution from protected-resource metadata ([1407](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/1407) by [@faizhasim](https://github.com/faizhasim))
- Added path-prefixed well-known URL fallback in OAuth discovery to support authorization servers behind gateways with sub-path routing ([1407](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/1407) by [@faizhasim](https://github.com/faizhasim))
- Added relative URL resolution for `Mcp-Auth-Server` header values against the server URL ([1407](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/1407) by [@faizhasim](https://github.com/faizhasim))

### Changed

- Changed Python shared eval sessions to be keyed by `sessionId` and `cwd` so code state no longer leaks across different directories when reusing a session
- Changed shared JavaScript and Python startup to deduplicate concurrent first-time session initialization so parallel first calls share one warm session
- Changed shared JavaScript and Python execution output handling so interleaved async runs keep their `display` output scoped to the originating run
- Changed Python tool bridge to use per-run identifiers alongside session IDs for correct routing of tool responses and output in concurrent evaluations
- Changed JavaScript and Python `eval` execution to allow overlapping asynchronous cells on the same session ID to run concurrently instead of being strictly queued
- Updated the edit mode option set to support `replace`, `patch`, `hashline`, and `apply_patch` variants
- Bare `A:` / `A-B:` (no payload, no inline body) now replaces the line/range with a single blank line, symmetric with bare `A↑` / `A↓` inserting a blank line; previously rejected as ambiguous
- Simplified hashline anchor format from `LINE+HASH` to bare `LINE` numbers in edit operations
- Updated hashline file headers to include 4-hex file hash: `¶PATH#HASH` format for anchored edits
- Changed hashline line separator from `|` to `:` in editable output (e.g., `42:content` instead of `42ab|content`)
- Removed per-line hash validation; file-level hash now validates entire section integrity
- Updated read/search output to emit file-hash headers (`¶PATH#HASH`) followed by numbered lines for hashline mode
- Modified hashline grammar to accept optional file hash in headers and removed hash requirements from line anchors
- Changed hashline diff preview format to use `LINE:content` instead of `LINE+HASH|content`
- Updated prompt documentation to reflect new `¶PATH#HASH` header and bare line-number syntax
- Bare `A:` / `A-B:` (no payload, no inline body) now replaces the line/range with a single blank line, symmetric with bare `A↑` / `A↓` inserting a blank line; previously rejected as ambiguous
- Simplified hashline anchor format from `LINE+HASH` to bare `LINE` numbers in edit operations
- Updated hashline file headers to include 4-hex file hash: `¶PATH#HASH` format for anchored edits
- Changed hashline line separator from `|` to `:` in editable output (e.g., `42:content` instead of `42ab|content`)
- Removed per-line hash validation; file-level hash now validates entire section integrity
- Updated read/search output to emit file-hash headers (`¶PATH#HASH`) followed by numbered lines for hashline mode
- Modified hashline grammar to accept optional file hash in headers and removed hash requirements from line anchors
- Changed hashline diff preview format to use `LINE:content` instead of `LINE+HASH|content`
- Updated prompt documentation to reflect new `¶PATH#HASH` header and bare line-number syntax
- Updated `discoverOAuthEndpoints` to accept `resourceMetadataUrl` parameter and prioritize the resource-metadata chain ([1407](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/1407) by [@faizhasim](https://github.com/faizhasim))
- Updated `parseMcpAuthServerUrl` and `extractMcpAuthServerUrl` to accept optional `serverUrl` for relative URL resolution ([1407](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/1407) by [@faizhasim](https://github.com/faizhasim))
- Updated `MCPOAuthFlow.#resolveRegistrationEndpoint` to try origin-root well-known first, then fall back to path-prefixed well-known ([1407](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/1407) by [@faizhasim](https://github.com/faizhasim))

### Removed
- Removed the `installH2Fetch()` activation from CLI startup; HTTPS fetches now use Bun's default transport
- Removed the `vim` edit mode along with the `VimTool` module, prompt, and supporting buffer/engine/renderer stack
- Removed per-line hash anchors (2-letter bigram hashes) from hashline format
- Removed `RANGE_INTERIOR_HASH` constant; multi-line ranges no longer use `**` filler
- Removed `HashMismatch` type and hash mismatch error reporting; replaced with file-level validation
- Removed per-line hash anchors (2-letter bigram hashes) from hashline format
- Removed `RANGE_INTERIOR_HASH` constant; multi-line ranges no longer use `**` filler
- Removed `HashMismatch` type and hash mismatch error reporting; replaced with file-level validation

### Fixed

- Fixed missing `await` on `#tryWellKnownForRegistration` call in `#resolveRegistrationEndpoint` that caused path-prefixed well-known fallback to never actually execute, returning the unresolved Promise object instead of the registration endpoint ([1407](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/1407) by [@faizhasim](https://github.com/faizhasim))
- Fixed JavaScript module reloading to refresh local re-exports when transitive dependency files are edited
- Fixed Python tool calls in warm kernels to initialize once bridge environment variables appear after startup and to return a clear `tool bridge is unavailable` error when missing
- Fixed IRC `send` handling to preserve recipient incoming messages when auto-reply timeouts instead of dropping them
- Fixed Python session disposal to cancel all concurrent active executions in a shared kernel
- Fixed JavaScript `eval` imports to preserve module-level singletons across re-imports of unchanged local files and reload them only after edits
- Fixed concurrent Python evaluator tool calls to use per-run identifiers so tool responses and output are routed to the correct execution
- Fixed the `search` tool argument validation to accept a single string `paths` value as a one-path search.
## [15.4.0] - 2026-05-26

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced the hashline patch format from `§`, `«`, `»`, `≔`, and `..` to `¶`, `↑`, `↓`, `→` with range separators written as `A-B`, requiring users to migrate hashline edit inputs

### Added

- Added resolved subagent model badge to the task widget status line showing `<provider>/<id>` (with optional `:<thinkingLevel>` suffix when thinking is set explicitly), opt-in via `task.showResolvedModelBadge` Appearance setting (default off)
- Added `codex` and `gemini` to the web search provider settings so users can configure OpenAI and Gemini web search directly from provider selection
- Added OpenAI (`codex`) and Gemini web search options with updated setup descriptions for `omp /login openai-codex` and Gemini OAuth login
- Added pretty-printing for wide JSON `data:` payloads in the raw provider-stream debug viewer so streamed event bodies expand across multiple `data:` lines instead of getting clipped by the per-line truncator, and updated the viewer header to read `raw provider stream (SSE + WS)` now that Codex WebSocket frames also flow through the buffer
- Added per-tool approval policies with a `--auto-approve` (alias `--yolo`) CLI flag to bypass confirmation prompts for automation. Each tool call resolves a policy of `allow` / `deny` / `prompt` via a six-level lookup: overriding action exceptions, validated user config, non-overriding action exceptions, built-in defaults, validated user `_default`, and a system `prompt` fallback.
- Added `tools.approval.<toolName>: allow | deny | prompt` user config support via the settings schema. Invalid values (non-strings, unknown literals) are now ignored and fall through to the built-in default instead of being silently honoured — preventing a typo from locking the user out of a tool or bypassing approval for one.
- Added action-based exception registry covering LSP read-only actions (`diagnostics`/`definition`/`references`/etc. → `allow`), DAP debug inspection actions (`threads`/`stack_trace`/`variables`/`scopes`/`read_memory`/etc. → `allow`), and critical bash patterns (`rm -rf /`, `sudo rm`, fork bombs, `chmod -R 777 /`, `chown -R user /`, `curl ... | bash`, `bash <(curl ...)`, writes to `/etc/passwd|shadow|sudoers`, `shutdown`/`reboot`/`halt`/`init 0`/`kill -9 1`, `nc -e`/`nc -c` reverse shells → always `prompt`, even when bash is user-allowed).
- Added approval check in `ExtensionToolWrapper.execute()` ahead of extension `tool_call` handlers, with an actionable error in non-interactive sessions (`--auto-approve` / `tools.approval.<tool>: allow` guidance).
- Added MCP-tool labelling and bash/ssh command truncation in the approval prompt so `mcp__<server>__<tool>` calls are tagged as MCP server tools and a heredoc-sized command body doesn't blow out the confirmation dialog.
- Added `docs/approval-mode.md` user guide and a 57-case unit suite covering the resolution order, every critical-bash pattern (with benign-keyword negatives to lock false-positives out), user-config validation, and prompt formatting.
- Added `tools.approvalMode` global setting (Interaction tab in `/settings`) with values `auto` | `prompt` | `custom`. Defaults to `auto` so the agent runs every tool call without interruption — matching the `--auto-approve` / `--yolo` CLI flag. `prompt` uses built-in per-tool defaults only (read/find/search auto-allow; bash/edit/write/eval/ssh require confirmation; `tools.approval.<tool>` config is ignored). `custom` makes the `tools.approval.<tool>` config the source of truth — your settings win over built-in defaults, which fall back only for tools you haven't configured. CLI `--auto-approve` always wins. Critical safety patterns (e.g. `rm -rf /`, `curl … | bash`, fork bombs) keep prompting even when the tool is user-allowed.
- Extended `CRITICAL_BASH_PATTERNS` to cover `source <(curl …)` / `. <(curl …)` and `eval "$(curl …)"` / `eval $(curl …)` / ``eval `curl …` `` (all common remote-fetch-then-execute shapes that the original `bash <(curl …)` regex missed), `chmod -R` symbolic modes (`u+x`, `u+rwx,o+w`) targeting filesystem root, and `tee` / `tee -a` writes to `/etc/{passwd,shadow,sudoers}`. Benign forms (`source ./local.sh`, `find . -name foo`, `chmod -R u+x ./build`, `tee /var/log/app.log`, `eval "$VAR"`) are pinned negative in the suite so future expansion can't regress false-positive rate.
- Extended `formatApprovalPrompt` with payload previews for `eval` (language + first cell's code), `task` (agent + first task's id + assignment), `ast_edit` (first op's pattern / replacement / paths), `browser` (action + tab + url + code), and `write` content (alongside path). Previously these all rendered as bare `Allow tool: <name>` lines, giving the user no signal about what they were authorizing.
- Decoupled the per-tool approval gate from extension-loading state: `ExtensionRunner` and the `ExtensionToolWrapper` per-tool gate are now constructed unconditionally in `createAgentSession`, regardless of whether any extensions are loaded. Previously the runner was created only when `extensionsResult.extensions.length > 0`, which silently disabled the entire approval system if no extensions (including `createAutoresearchExtension`) were loaded; a regression test in `approval-mode.test.ts` now locks the invariant.

### Fixed

- Fixed `isMcpToolName` over-matching any tool name containing `__` (an extension legally named `my__feature` or `pkg__util__do` was getting falsely labelled `Origin: MCP server tool` in the approval prompt). Restricted to the canonical `mcp__` prefix only.

### Changed

- Updated hashline operation syntax to support inline payload text on the same op line for insert and replace (`ANCHOR↑/↓/...→`) while still accepting payload lines that follow
- Updated hashline anchor parsing so copied `|TEXT` decorations remain cosmetic and payload must be provided on or after the operator
- Unified subagent output-schema validation into a single shared module (`tools/output-schema-validator.ts`) used by both the in-process `yield` tool (validates before the subagent yields) and the executor's post-mortem `finalizeSubprocessOutput` path (validates after subprocess exit). Previously each side ran its own `normalizeSchema` → `jtdToJsonSchema` → `validateJsonSchemaValue` chain in parallel, which was semantically equivalent but invited drift: a future tweak on one side could silently disagree with the other and cause yields that pass in-tool to fail post-mortem (or vice versa). The unification preserves both call sites' existing behavior (yield throws an actionable per-issue error for the model; executor produces a `schema_violation` outcome with the first issue and missing-required fields) by exposing two output formatters (`formatAllValidationIssues` for retries, `formatValidationIssueHeadline` for headlines).
- Changed web search provider credential lookup to use the shared `AuthStorage` pipeline (`getApiKey`/`getOAuthAccess`) for API-key and OAuth auth instead of direct `AgentStorage` access
- Changed the `codex` web search provider display label from `Codex` to `OpenAI`
- Updated `anthropic` and `openai`/`gemini` web search option descriptions to reflect their native `web_search`/OAuth requirements

### Fixed

- Fixed hashline inline payload parsing so same-line payloads containing whitespace, including tab-indented text, are preserved instead of being rejected
- Fixed Bun HTTP/2 transport errors (`HTTP2StreamReset`, `HTTP2RefusedStream`, and `HTTP2EnhanceYourCalm`) to be treated as transient so the assistant now retries automatically instead of stopping on these recoverable failures
- Fixed web search OAuth-backed providers (including Codex and Gemini) to use broker-managed token retrieval and account metadata, avoiding direct token-store refresh behavior that could cause search authentication failures
- Updated Tavily missing-credential feedback to prompt users to configure an API-key provider setting instead of referencing `agent.db` directly
- Refreshed expired OpenAI Codex OAuth tokens during `web_search` execution and persisted the updated credentials so searches continue working after token expiry
- Fixed the browser tool's existing-tab re-navigation path (`tab-supervisor.acquireTab`) still defaulting to `waitUntil: "networkidle2"` while the new-tab worker switched to `"load"`. Identical `acquireTab({url})` calls behaved differently depending on whether the named tab was fresh or being reused — fresh tabs returned quickly, second invocations hung on dev servers with persistent WebSocket / HMR connections. Both paths now agree on `"load"`.
- Fixed the `patch` tool's post-write verification `ToolError` embedding the absolute `resolvedPath` in its user-facing message; the outer composer in `executeSinglePathEntries` then prepended `Error editing ${path}: …`, double-embedding the path and leaking `$HOME` into the TUI. The error message now uses the caller-supplied relative `path` (matching the success branches); `resolvedPath` is retained only in the structured `context` metadata for log correlation.
- Fixed `splitInternalUrlSel` keeping `mcp://` resource URIs fully opaque, including selector-shaped suffixes like `:raw`, `:1-50`, and `/:raw`. `McpProtocolHandler` resolves resources by verbatim URI match (`r.uri === uri`), so peeling before resource lookup can make valid server-defined resource IDs unreachable. MCP read-selector support now requires a future resolver-aware path that can try the exact URI before interpreting any suffix as a selector; non-MCP internal URL selectors are unchanged.
- Fixed three correctness issues in the `find` tool. (1) `onMatch` guard checked the outer task `signal?.aborted` instead of `combinedSignal.aborted` (which also includes the per-call timeout signal), so late matches accumulated past the timeout. (2) Timeout-drained partial results were emitted in insertion order while the normal path sorts by mtime descending; callers relying on "most recently modified first" got an inconsistent ordering when the call timed out. The timeout drain now tracks per-entry mtime in a parallel array and applies the same comparator. (3) `validateFindPathInputs` now skips backslash-escaped commas (`\,`) when checking for top-level commas, matching `search.ts:containsTopLevelComma`.
- Fixed `throwPreferredDapStartError` using a single `await Promise.resolve()` (one microtask) to let a concurrent launch/attach rejection settle before deciding which error to surface. That worked for synchronous-rejection test fakes but not real adapter I/O: the launch failure arrives via socket and lands several ticks after the `configurationDone` failure. `DapStartRequestFailure` now carries a `settled?: Promise<void>` that resolves when the underlying request settles either way, and `throwPreferredDapStartError` races against it with a 50 ms ceiling. The preferred error message (the underlying launch/attach failure rather than the cascade) now surfaces under real I/O.
- Fixed `adapter: "debugpy"` over-promising in the `debug` tool. `resolveAdapter("debugpy", cwd)` only checks for `python` in `PATH`; it does not verify that the `debugpy` module is importable. Both failure modes — `python` missing and `debugpy` module missing — used to collapse onto a generic `"No suitable debug adapter found"` error. The launch/attach action now throws a targeted `ToolError` naming `python` when `resolveAdapter` returns null for an explicit `adapter: "debugpy"`, and the `DapSessionManager` spawn-catch detects `"No module named debugpy"` in adapter stderr and surfaces a `pip install debugpy` hint. The Python debug tool documentation lists the install hint so the prompt and runtime diagnostics agree.
- Fixed the LSP symbol-resolver `BARE_IDENTIFIER_RE` (`/^[A-Za-z_][\w]*$/`) rejecting `$`-prefixed identifiers (`$store`, `$count`, RxJS observables, Svelte stores, Angular signals). Without the word-boundary check, searching for `$store` on a line containing `bar$store` returned the offset inside the compound identifier rather than the standalone occurrence, feeding a wrong column to the LSP server. Pattern now `/^[$A-Za-z_][\w$]*$/`; the companion `IDENTIFIER_CHAR_RE` already contained `$`.
- Fixed `applyWorkspaceEdit` writing all text edits before walking `documentChanges` for resource operations. LSP §3.16.2 requires clients to apply `documentChanges` in declared order, so any server emitting `{kind: "create", uri: X}` followed by a `TextDocumentEdit` for `X` (e.g. "Extract to new file" code actions, some rename responses) broke: the edit ran against a non-existent file, then the create happened. `applyWorkspaceEdit` now walks `documentChanges` once in declared order; per-URI text edits are coalesced into a pending Map and flushed immediately before any subsequent resource op for the same URI. Legacy `changes`-map-only payloads are unchanged. Folder-level `rename`/`delete` ops now flush every pending URI under the affected subtree (not just the exact target) so child-file edits queued before a parent-folder move land at the original location instead of dangling against a non-existent path on the final flush. Rename ops additionally flush pending edits queued against `renameOp.newUri` (and its descendants) **before** `fs.rename` runs, so edits intended for the pre-rename target file are applied before the rename clobbers or replaces it (relevant under `options.overwrite`/`options.ignoreIfExists`). When a `WorkspaceEdit` payload supplies both `changes` and `documentChanges`, the `documentChanges` arm is now used exclusively per LSP §3.16.2 ("if documentChanges are supplied … servers should use them in preference to changes"); previously the two were merged.

### Fixed

- Fixed built-in `explore` agent failing every invocation with `schema_violation: files.0.ref: must not be present` on releases prior to 15.3.2 by renaming the `files[].ref` property to `files[].path` in the agent's output schema; `ref` is a JTD-reserved keyword (RFC 8927) and collides with JSON Type Definition's schema-reference form, so the converter previously dropped it from the generated JSON Schema. Defense-in-depth alongside the 15.3.2 converter fix ([#1379](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1379)).
- Increased the `yield` tool's schema-validation retry budget from 1 to 3 so subagents whose first structured-output attempt mismatches the declared output schema get up to three retries before the parent's post-mortem `schema_violation` check hard-fails the task. The tool now also surfaces remaining retry attempts and an explicit "call yield again with the corrected shape" directive in each rejection message, giving the model the context it needs to converge — particularly helpful for models like GLM that tend to invent per-element field names instead of following the declared schema.
- Fixed CLI PDF file arguments being decoded as raw bytes for local vision models; `.pdf` and other supported document files now go through the same Markit conversion path as the `read` tool before entering the prompt ([#1401](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1401)).
- Fixed the `bash` tool hanging until the 305 s hard timeout when a command writes a file via heredoc on Windows (bodies > ~4 KiB) or macOS (bodies > 16-64 KiB). Root cause was in the embedded brush shell; see `@oh-my-pi/pi-natives` changelog for the underlying fix.

### Fixed

- Fixed `/review` custom prompt orchestration text to use static prompt templates and consistently instruct reviewer task delegation.
- Fixed `/review` custom-instructions submission on terminals that cannot distinguish Ctrl+Enter by using prompt-style input where Enter submits and Shift+Enter inserts a newline.
- Fixed hook editor submissions sending large-paste placeholders such as `[paste #1 +27 lines]` instead of the pasted content.
- Added per-tool approval policies with a `--auto-approve` (alias `--yolo`) CLI flag to bypass confirmation prompts for automation. Each tool call resolves a policy of `allow` / `deny` / `prompt` via a six-level lookup: overriding action exceptions, validated user config, non-overriding action exceptions, built-in defaults, validated user `_default`, and a system `prompt` fallback.
- Added `tools.approval.<toolName>: allow | deny | prompt` user config support via the settings schema. Invalid values (non-strings, unknown literals) are now ignored and fall through to the built-in default instead of being silently honoured — preventing a typo from locking the user out of a tool or bypassing approval for one.
- Added action-based exception registry covering LSP read-only actions (`diagnostics`/`definition`/`references`/etc. → `allow`), DAP debug inspection actions (`threads`/`stack_trace`/`variables`/`scopes`/`read_memory`/etc. → `allow`), and critical bash patterns (`rm -rf /`, `sudo rm`, fork bombs, `chmod -R 777 /`, `chown -R user /`, `curl ... | bash`, `bash <(curl ...)`, writes to `/etc/passwd|shadow|sudoers`, `shutdown`/`reboot`/`halt`/`init 0`/`kill -9 1`, `nc -e`/`nc -c` reverse shells → always `prompt`, even when bash is user-allowed).
- Added approval check in `ExtensionToolWrapper.execute()` ahead of extension `tool_call` handlers, with an actionable error in non-interactive sessions (`--auto-approve` / `tools.approval.<tool>: allow` guidance).
- Added MCP-tool labelling and bash/ssh command truncation in the approval prompt so `mcp__<server>__<tool>` calls are tagged as MCP server tools and a heredoc-sized command body doesn't blow out the confirmation dialog.
- Added `docs/approval-mode.md` user guide and a 57-case unit suite covering the resolution order, every critical-bash pattern (with benign-keyword negatives to lock false-positives out), user-config validation, and prompt formatting.
- Added `tools.approvalMode` global setting (Interaction tab in `/settings`) with values `auto` | `prompt` | `custom`. Defaults to `auto` so the agent runs every tool call without interruption — matching the `--auto-approve` / `--yolo` CLI flag. `prompt` uses built-in per-tool defaults only (read/find/search auto-allow; bash/edit/write/eval/ssh require confirmation; `tools.approval.<tool>` config is ignored). `custom` makes the `tools.approval.<tool>` config the source of truth — your settings win over built-in defaults, which fall back only for tools you haven't configured. CLI `--auto-approve` always wins. Critical safety patterns (e.g. `rm -rf /`, `curl … | bash`, fork bombs) keep prompting even when the tool is user-allowed.

## [15.3.2] - 2026-05-25
### Added

- Added inline `|TEXT` payload support to `»` and `«` hashline insert operations, allowing single-line inserts on the op line and still supporting additional payload lines
- Added support for using inline payloads with BOF/EOF inserts so `|TEXT` is treated as inserted content at file boundaries
- Added live nested-`task` rendering: while a subagent is mid-flight, the parent UI now surfaces both completed nested `task` sub-calls and the in-flight nested snapshot (forwarded from `tool_execution_update`), matching the finished-result tree
- Added `omp auth-gateway check` (and matching `GET /v1/credentials/check` endpoint) — probes each broker-supplied credential against its provider's auth-verifying usage endpoint and prints per-credential health, so when a multi-account pool starts returning 401s you can identify which row in the broker is the bad one. The existing `/v1/usage` endpoint silently drops failed credentials, which is the wrong shape for diagnosing auth — the new endpoint captures errors and surfaces the credential's id, provider, type, email/accountId, and the upstream error string. CLI groups results per-provider, exits non-zero when any credential failed, and supports `--json` for scripting. The probe also exercises OAuth refresh on expired tokens, so a working refresh + working access reports as `ok` and a revoked refresh token reports as `oauth refresh failed: …` instead of being masked by the cached expired access token.

### Fixed

- Fixed parsing of inline `|TEXT` payloads containing whitespace on `»` and `«` inserts, which previously failed with unrecognized-op errors
- Fixed anchored insert handling so an inline `|TEXT` body matching the anchor line is treated as anchor decoration and no longer inserted as a duplicate

## [15.3.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- Added `OMP_NO_WEBP` environment variable to disable WebP encoding in image resize, fixing HTTP 400 errors when attaching browser snapshots to vision models running on local llama.cpp (which uses STB library that lacks WebP support)
- Fixed loop mode submitting the next prompt while a background async-job delivery turn (idle flush) was still pending, which could cause the job result to be silently dropped and make the session appear to keep firing while work was ongoing ([#1294](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1294))
- Fixed clipboard image paste (Ctrl+V) silently failing on WSL2 by routing image reads through a `powershell.exe` bridge when WSL interop is detected, since `arboard` returns `ContentNotAvailable` under WSLg ([#1280](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1280))
- Fixed `bash` tool timeout and ESC cancellation getting stuck when native shell cleanup stalls; the JavaScript-side deadline now returns the tool result on schedule while native cleanup continues in the background ([#1347](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1347))
- Fixed reviewer agent always failing JTD validation with `findings.0.priority: expected number, received string` whenever `report_finding` surfaced a finding; the tool's `"P0"`-`"P3"` priority is now coerced to its numeric ordinal before populating the auto-injected `findings[]` ([#1350](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1350))
- Fixed config-only marketplace LSP plugins such as `csharp-lsp` not registering servers with the CLI when the plugin cache has only marketplace metadata and no package code ([#1352](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1352)).
- Fixed JTD-to-JSON-Schema conversion treating user-named properties as nested JTD forms when their keys collided with JTD keywords like `ref`, which broke the built-in explore agent's output validator with `schema_violation: files.0.ref: must not be present` ([#1345](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1345))
- Fixed extension `ctx.ui.notify()` messages emitted during `session_start` being cleared before the first interactive render ([#1316](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1316)).
- Fixed append-only context mode not being recomputed after model switches — the mode was frozen at session construction time using the initial model's provider, so `provider.appendOnlyContext=auto` left append-only enabled after switching away from DeepSeek (or disabled after switching to DeepSeek) for the rest of the session

### Fixed
- Fixed clipboard image paste (Ctrl+V) silently failing on WSL2 by routing image reads through a `powershell.exe` bridge when WSL interop is detected, since `arboard` returns `ContentNotAvailable` under WSLg ([#1280](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1280))
## [15.2.4] - 2026-05-22
### Breaking Changes

- Replaced the legacy `@@` header and `+`/`<`/`=`/`-` hashline syntax with the new `§PATH` header and `«`/`»`/`≔` operation format, so existing hashline scripts and prompts using old symbols must be updated

### Added

- Added one-anchor `≔ANCHOR` shorthand equivalent to `≔ANCHOR..ANCHOR` for single-line replace/delete

### Changed

- Changed `≔A..B` so an omitted payload now deletes the range, and added an explicit empty payload line to keep a literal blank replacement line

### Removed

- Removed the `hsep` prompt helper and `PI_HL_SEP` payload-prefix configuration because hashline payloads are no longer line-prefixed

### Fixed

- Fixed hashline payload handling in parser and streaming preview to preserve blank lines as actual payload text until the next op, file header, or envelope marker

## [15.2.3] - 2026-05-22
### Breaking Changes

- Changed PR and task-isolation worktree directory layout to hash-based `~/.omp/wt/<identifier>-<path-hash>` style paths, replacing the previous nested encoded-repo layout

### Added

- Added `omp worktree` command (alias `wt`) to list and manage agent-managed worktrees under `~/.omp/wt`
- Added `omp worktree clear` to remove orphaned worktree directories, with `--all` to include live PR-checkouts, `--dry-run` for preview, and `--json` reporting
- Added machine-readable JSON output to `omp worktree list` for scripted inspection
- Added `display.shimmer` appearance setting with `classic`, `kitt` (Knight Rider K.I.T.T. scanner), and `disabled` modes

### Changed

- Changed the welcome intro animation to a 3-second eased gradient sweep with a diagonal shine highlight across the logo
- Changed background job completion follow-ups to batch multiple finished jobs into a single `async-result` message, showing each completed job and its result in one place
- Changed MCP notification follow-ups to combine multiple resource updates into a single consolidated message and suppress duplicate server/uri entries
- Updated PR checkout to reuse `hashPath`-based worktree roots when creating and scanning worktrees for cleanup
- Updated `worktree` cleanup logic to gracefully prune parent git metadata after removing worktree directories
- Reworked working-message shimmer animation for 60fps rendering: ANSI sequences are coalesced per same-tier run instead of emitted per code point, palettes compile once and cache per active theme, and the band position is now fractional so motion is smooth at any frame rate
- Switched MCP health-check and "Connecting to…" spinners from hard-coded ASCII (`|/-\`) to `theme.spinnerFrames` so they pick up the active symbol preset (braille on unicode/nerd, ASCII when explicitly themed)

### Fixed

- Fixed PR checkout failures when the default worktree path was already registered or occupied by stale leftovers by automatically selecting suffixed alternatives (`-2`, `-3`, etc.)
- Fixed Memory tab in the settings UI not revealing or hiding the Hindsight-only rows (`Hindsight API URL`, `Hindsight Bank ID`, `Hindsight Scoping`, etc.) when `Memory Backend` was switched via the inline submenu. The selector now rebuilds its item list after every change so condition-gated rows appear/disappear immediately instead of requiring a tab switch

## [15.2.2] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- Fixed `RULES.md` not being injected. The documented sticky-rules file at `~/.omp/agent/RULES.md` and `<repo>/.omp/RULES.md` was never read by any discovery provider; only `.omp/rules/*.md` was scanned. The native provider now loads both as always-apply rules so they re-attach every turn as documented ([#1266](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1266)).

## [15.2.1] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- Fixed compaction routing to the wrong provider when `modelRoles.default` is set to a different model than the active chat. Auto- and manual compaction now prefer the active session's model and only fall back to role-based candidates when the current model has no usable credentials. Previously, an Anthropic chat with `modelRoles.default = openai/gpt-5` would compact through OpenAI (including the remote-compaction endpoint), even though the live conversation never used OpenAI.

### Fixed

- Fixed context overflow not being detected when the session's model (e.g. `hf:zai-org/GLM-5.1` via `synthetic` provider) returns a 400 with the upstream "400 status code (no body)" message wrapped inside a JSON envelope. The `isContextOverflow` check now matches the no-body status phrase anywhere in the error string rather than requiring it at the very start, so auto-compaction fires correctly instead of leaving the session silently stuck ([#1251](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1251)).
- Fixed `formatCapturedHttpError` not extracting the error text from `{"error":"string"}` response bodies (only object-valued `error` fields were previously handled), resulting in raw JSON in error messages instead of the human-readable string.

## [15.2.0] - 2026-05-21

### Changed

- Changed the interactive working loader and slash-command progress bars to use the active theme's accent shimmer instead of static muted text.

### Fixed

- Fixed false-positive hashline `~ TEXT` separator-padding warning firing on YAML, JSON, Python, Markdown, TOML, and other indent-sensitive file edits. The padding check is now skipped entirely for indentation-sensitive extensions (`.py`, `.yml`/`.yaml`, `.md`/`.mdx`, `.json`/`.jsonc`/`.json5`, `.toml`, `.rst`, `.tf`, `.nix`, `.coffee`, `.haml`/`.slim`/`.pug`, `.sass`/`.styl`, `.nim`, `.cr`, `.elm`, `.fs`, …), and tightened on every other extension to flag only the `~ beta` typo shape (exactly one leading space before non-space content) rather than any leading-space payload.

### Fixed

- Fixed goal state machine: `get` now returns paused goals (was returning null for `enabled=false`), `complete` now works on paused goals after interrupts, `create` is allowed after a previous goal reaches `complete` status, and the goal tool is re-added to the active tool set on session reload when a paused goal is persisted. Added `resume` and `drop` ops to the goal tool so the agent can re-engage or discard a paused goal without requiring user slash commands. ([#1249](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1249))

## [15.1.9] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- Fixed `disabledProviders` still probing local discovery endpoints for Ollama, llama.cpp, and LM Studio during background model refresh. Disabled providers are now excluded before implicit and built-in discovery managers are created. ([#1232](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1232))

### Fixed

- Fixed `omp acp` auto-discovering host `.mcp.json` servers in parallel with the ACP client's `session/new.mcpServers`, which shadowed client-supplied MCP tools in `search_tool_bm25` and the session tool registry. The ACP session factory now forces `enableMCP: false`, so MCP ownership stays with `AcpAgent#configureMcpServers`. Non-ACP modes keep on-disk discovery. ([#1234](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1234))

### Fixed

- Fixed binary `omp update` rollbacks so a downloaded replacement that fails post-install version verification no longer remains installed over the previous working binary. ([#1240](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1240))

### Fixed

- Fixed `/force <tool>` rejecting Ollama/local models before the requested tool could run; Ollama now receives a named forced choice that the provider transport narrows to the selected tool. ([#1236](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1236))

### Fixed

- Fixed `web_search` freezing the session when an upstream provider stalled. Bun's WinHTTP backend on Windows can silently drop `AbortSignal` once a TCP/TLS connection hangs (oven-sh/bun#15275, oven-sh/bun#18536), so Esc never reached the in-flight fetch and the only recovery was Ctrl+C + `omp --resume`. Every web-search provider's outbound `fetch` (anthropic, brave, codex, exa, gemini, jina, kagi, kimi, parallel, perplexity, searxng, synthetic, tavily, z.ai) now composes the caller signal with a 60s hard timeout via a shared `withHardTimeout` helper, guaranteeing the request settles within a minute even when Bun's abort fails to propagate. Independently, `executeSearch`'s provider-fallback loop was masking real cancellations as ordinary provider errors and returning "All web search providers failed"; it now re-throws as `ToolAbortError` the moment the caller's signal aborts, so the session sees a clean cancel on every platform. ([#1221](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1221))

### Added

- Added OSC 8 terminal hyperlink support for file paths in tool output. When the terminal supports hyperlinks (kitty, Ghostty, WezTerm, iTerm2, Alacritty, VS Code) and the new `tui.hyperlinks` setting is `auto` (default) or `always`, OMP wraps file paths emitted by `read`, `find`, `search`, `edit`, `ast_grep`, and `ast_edit` renderers in `file:///abs/path` hyperlinks. `local://` and other fs-backed internal URLs resolve to their backing path. Set `tui.hyperlinks: off` to disable. ([#1244](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1244))

## [15.1.8] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- Fixed streaming edit previews for `apply_patch` and `hashline` jittering as the model typed `+added` lines. Two root causes addressed: (1) the trailing partial line of the streaming text input is now trimmed at each tick so a half-typed `+added` line no longer flickers; (2) the preview is rendered in the model's input order during streaming instead of re-deriving a unified diff via `Diff.structuredPatch`, whose coalescing previously reshuffled existing `+added` lines downward each time a new `-removed` line arrived. Existing additions now stay put and the preview only grows at the bottom while streaming. A residual trailing `-removed`/hunk-header block whose matching `+added` companion has not yet arrived is also suppressed until the additions land.
- Fixed Perplexity web search appearing "logged out" roughly an hour after `omp auth login perplexity`. The search provider's `findOAuthToken` was honoring the bogus `expires = login_time + 1h` written by older logins (Perplexity JWTs typically omit `exp` because sessions are server-side) and silently dropping the credential. The loader now decodes the JWT's `exp` claim directly and only skips when the JWT itself is expired; tokens without an `exp` claim are treated as non-expiring.

### Fixed

- Fixed `legacy-pi-compat` failing to load plugin extensions (e.g. `pi-schedule-prompt@0.3.0`) that import `@mariozechner/pi-ai` when running from a compiled binary. `getResolvedSpecifier` called `Bun.resolveSync` against `import.meta.dir` inside `/$bunfs/root`, where the virtual FS exposes no resolvable `node_modules` tree at runtime; the throw silently dropped the plugin. The fix lets `rewriteLegacyPiImports` fall back gracefully on resolution failure so that `rewriteBareImportsForLegacyExtension` — which already runs immediately after — can resolve the original specifier against the plugin's own installed peer deps instead. The same fallback is applied to `resolveLegacyPiSpecifier` (the Bun plugin shim's `onResolve` handler) for tool/hook files loaded directly via Bun's import system. ([#1215](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1215))

## [15.1.7] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- Fixed `debug` launch/attach failures so `configurationDone` no longer masks the underlying DAP launch error, early stop-outcome watchers cannot emit unhandled rejections, and directory-valued launch programs are rejected before adapter selection. ([#1187](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1187))
- Fixed hashline edit payloads that use a readability space after `~` by warning on separator-padding-shaped payload blocks and tightening the model prompt. ([#1166](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1166))
- Fixed ACP bash permission requests to include execute tool metadata and command content so clients can render command approval prompts consistently. ([#1189](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1189))
- Fixed the status-line fast-mode indicator (`⚡`) rendering for scoped service tiers (`openai-only`, `claude-only`) even when the active model's provider didn't realize them — e.g. `serviceTier: "openai-only"` would still show the indicator next to a Claude model the wire request couldn't apply fast mode to. The indicator now consults a new `AgentSession.isFastModeActive()` predicate that runs the configured tier through `resolveServiceTier(tier, model.provider)` and only lights up when the result is `"priority"` for the current model. `isFastModeEnabled()` keeps its scope-aware semantics so `/fast on|off|toggle` and `/fast status` continue to reflect the user's configured intent.
### Fixed

- Fixed status-line context% computation freezing the UI for ~1.1 s every 2 s on long sessions (2,000+ messages). The earlier alignment fix (which uses `computeContextBreakdown` to match the `/context` slash command) was running on every agent event via `updateEditorTopBorder()` (event-controller.ts:163), and `computeContextBreakdown` walks every message through the native `countTokens` tokenizer (~0.5 ms each) — for the user's 2,312-message session this was ~1,120 ms synchronous blocking per cache miss, producing the user-visible "jittery rendering" and "status bar disappearing during streaming". `StatusLineComponent.getCachedContextBreakdown()` now uses an incremental per-message token cache: messages are walked ONCE during warm-up, and subsequent refreshes only compute tokens for the NEW messages appended since last call (typically 0–1 per refresh during streaming). The LAST message is always recomputed because its content may still be growing mid-stream; all prior messages are immutable once a newer message exists. Compaction (messages array shrinks) resets the cache. Non-message tokens (system prompt + tools + skills) are cached separately and invalidated via a cheap identity fingerprint. Result: 2,300-message warm refresh drops from ~1,120 ms to ~0.04 ms — 28,000× faster. Functional parity with the prior `computeContextBreakdown` path is preserved.

### Added

- Added scoped service tier values to the `serviceTier` setting: `priority (OpenAI only)` and `priority (Claude only)`. They let you opt into premium processing on one provider family without paying premium costs on the other when switching models mid-session. `/fast on` continues to set the unscoped `"priority"` (active everywhere supported); `/fast status` and `isFastModeEnabled()` now report `on` for any scoped value too.

### Changed

- Changed `/fast` to be a single provider-agnostic toggle: enabling the command sets `serviceTier: "priority"` for every provider, and the anthropic-messages provider translates `priority` into `speed: "fast"` plus the `fast-mode-2026-02-01` beta. Anthropic fast mode is currently supported on Claude Opus 4.6 and 4.7; the server rejects other models, which triggers the provider's auto-fallback (request retried without the priority signal, `providerSessionState.fastModeDisabled` persisted for the rest of the session). The session listens for the `"priority"` marker in `AssistantMessage.disabledFeatures`, syncs `/fast` off, and emits a warning notice. Re-running `/fast on` clears the per-session disable so the next request actually re-tries priority.

## [15.1.6] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- Fixed plan-mode `resolve` looping when grammar-constrained models (e.g. Qwen3.6-35B-MTP via llama.cpp) emit `extra: { title: {} }` instead of a string — the open `Record<string, unknown>` schema for `extra` lets such models drop in an empty object, and the apply guard then hard-threw on every retry. Plan approval now derives the title from `extra.title` when usable, falling back to the plan's first `# Heading`, then the plan filename stem (`local://PLAN.md` → `PLAN`), then the literal `"plan"`. Prompt language relaxed from "MUST" to "SHOULD" for `extra.title`. ([#1179](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1179))

## [15.1.5] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- Fixed `ast_grep` and `ast_edit` tool details retaining every per-file parse error — a scan over hundreds of files with syntax-error nodes inflated `details.parseErrors` to one entry per file, leaking into traces and the renderer's "X more" overflow. Errors are now capped at `PARSE_ERRORS_LIMIT` (20) at the source, with the original total preserved in a new `parseErrorsTotal` field for accurate count labels.

## [15.1.4] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- Fixed `normalizePlanTitle` rejecting plan titles that contain spaces or common punctuation (e.g. "My Feature Plan") — spaces are now converted to hyphens and other invalid characters are dropped, so models that produce natural-language plan titles no longer loop forever trying to call `resolve`. ([#1176](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1176))
- Fixed `ask` tool prompt example showing the legacy `question`/`options` top-level format instead of the current `questions: [{id, question, options}]` array format; models that closely followed the example generated calls that always failed schema validation. ([#1176](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1176))

- Fixed ACP command and custom tool-call notifications to carry the original tool arguments in replayed and final updates, so command text is preserved and raw input is no longer wrapped
- Fixed ACP async-job draining to be scoped by session owner so `getAsyncJobSnapshot` and `drainAsyncJobDeliveriesForAcp` no longer consume or expose jobs from other sessions
- Fixed async job status reporting to include in-flight completions so queued/delivering indicators remain accurate while callbacks are still running
- Fixed `deferAgentInitiatedTurns` handling during ACP async-job draining so background completion follow-up turns are delivered even when agent-initiated turns are deferred
- Fixed ACP ordinary file-editing calls (`edit`, `write`, `ast_edit`) incorrectly requesting `session/request_permission` before every call, while keeping permission prompts for edit operations that delete or move files; permission requests now report the gated tool call as `pending` so clients can render the approval UI instead of returning `Permission request cancelled` without a visible prompt. ([#1134](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/1134) by [@jiwangyihao](https://github.com/jiwangyihao))
- Fixed the session tree selector to preserve a readable message column when deeply nested branch gutters would otherwise consume the viewport. ([#1144](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1144))
- Fixed the TUI model selector to keep provider tab labels separate from provider ids, so the human-readable Ollama Cloud tab refreshes and filters `ollama-cloud` models correctly. ([#1153](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1153))

## [15.1.3] - 2026-05-17
### Breaking Changes

- Renamed the embedded-documentation internal URL scheme from `pi://` to `omp://`. `OmpProtocolHandler` replaces `PiProtocolHandler`; update any external references accordingly.
- Removed the `StringEnum` re-export from `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent`. Custom tools and extensions should use `z.enum([...])` directly via the injected `pi.zod`.
- Replaced the `eval` tool's LARK-grammar `input` string with a structured `cells` array. Each cell is `{ language: "py" | "js", code, title?, timeout?, reset? }`. Removed the implicit/sniffed language path, the `*** Cell` / `*** End` / `*** Abort` markers, and the per-cell `t:<duration>` unit suffixes — `timeout` is now seconds (1-600).

### Added

- Added `providers.<name>.transport: "pi-native"` to `models.yml`. When set, every model under that provider routes its streaming dispatch through the auth-gateway's `POST /v1/pi/stream` endpoint instead of the per-provider SDK. The provider's `baseUrl` must point at a compatible `omp auth-gateway` and `apiKey` must carry the gateway bearer. The slot's `models.json` still resolves locally for pricing/capabilities/thinking config; only the wire dispatch is redirected. Use case: containerized omp installs (robomp slots, swarm extension) where the slot must stay credential-free and a sidecar gateway holds the real provider tokens. Also surfaced as `transport` on `ProviderConfigInput` for extension-registered providers.
- Added optional backend push for the auto-QA grievance database (`dev.autoqaPush.enabled`, `dev.autoqaPush.endpoint`, `dev.autoqaPush.token`; env overrides `PI_AUTO_QA_PUSH`, `PI_AUTO_QA_PUSH_URL`, `PI_AUTO_QA_PUSH_TOKEN`). When enabled, every `report_tool_issue` call schedules a background flush that `POST`s pending rows to the configured endpoint and deletes them on HTTP 2xx. Each push carries a stable per-install UUID (`installId`) generated on first use and persisted at `~/.omp/install-id` via `getInstallId()` (new export from `@oh-my-pi/pi-utils`), so the receiver can dedup retries across host renames and `autoqa.db` wipes. Single-flight, 5s request timeout, 30s in-memory cooldown after failure, and a row-id watermark so rows inserted during an in-flight push survive and ship next time. Tool execution remains non-blocking and never throws.
- `ModelRegistry` now promotes `models.yml` `providers.<name>.apiKey` entries to `AuthStorage`'s new config-override tier (above OAuth, below `--api-key`). Pinning a bearer in `models.yml` was previously a no-op when the broker had an OAuth credential for the same provider — the OAuth access token won and got sent unmodified to whatever `baseUrl` you redirected to, which an auth-gateway in front of that endpoint rightly rejected with 401. The override is now honored, and is cleared/repopulated atomically on `models.yml` reload (`#reloadStaticModels` calls `clearConfigApiKeys` before re-parsing). Use case: route `anthropic` / `openai-codex` to `http://llm-gateway.internal:4000` with the gateway's own bearer.
- Added `omp auth-broker` subcommand for running and consuming a hosted credential vault.
- `serve [--bind=host:port]` — boots a local broker against the SQLite store at `$AGENT_DB_PATH`.
- `token [--regenerate]` — prints (and rotates) the bearer token stored at `~/.omp/auth-broker.token`.
- `login <provider> [--via=user@host] [--dry-run]` — drives the OAuth flow locally or via SSH `-L` tunnel into a remote broker (callback ports pinned per provider).
- `logout <provider>` — disables every credential for the given provider in the local SQLite store.
- `import <file|dir> [--provider=<id>] [--include-disabled] [--dry-run]` — imports CLIProxyAPI-style JSON credential dumps (`~/.cliproxy/auth/*.json`). When `OMP_AUTH_BROKER_URL` is configured, credentials are uploaded to the remote broker via `POST /v1/credential`; otherwise they go into the local SQLite store. JSON `type` is mapped to omp providers (`claude` → `anthropic`, `codex` → `openai-codex`, `gemini[-cli]` → `google-gemini-cli`, `antigravity` → `google-antigravity`); `--provider` overrides the mapping for unrecognized types.
- `status` — pings the configured remote broker (`OMP_AUTH_BROKER_URL`).
- Added remote credential vault support to `discoverAuthStorage`. Configure via env (`OMP_AUTH_BROKER_URL` / `OMP_AUTH_BROKER_TOKEN`) or by setting `auth.broker.url` and `auth.broker.token` in `~/.omp/agent/config.yml` (hidden from the settings UI; supports `!command` resolution). Falls back to `~/.omp/auth-broker.token` when no token is provided inline. Otherwise behavior is unchanged.
- Added `omp auth-broker migrate --from-local [--include-env] [--include-oauth] [--dry-run]` — uploads local SQLite credentials (and optionally env-var API keys) to the configured broker. Skips anything already on the broker via identity-key matching. OAuth is skipped by default (handled via `cliproxy` import). Idempotent on re-runs.
- Added `omp auth-gateway` subcommand for running a forward-proxy that hides access tokens from less-trusted clients:
- `serve [--bind=…]` — boots the gateway against the configured broker. Listens on `127.0.0.1:4000` by default.
- `token [--regenerate]` — manages the gateway bearer token at `~/.omp/auth-gateway.token` (separate from the broker bearer).
- `status` — verifies gateway config and authenticated broker readiness.
- One wire surface: `POST /v1/chat/completions` (OpenAI chat-completions), `POST /v1/messages` (Anthropic messages), `POST /v1/responses` (OpenAI Responses), `GET /v1/usage` (aggregated, 5-min per-credential cache), `GET /v1/models` (catalog). Model id in the request body selects which omp provider/model services it; the gateway translates wire format ↔ omp canonical `Context` and dispatches through `pi-ai` `streamSimple()`. Container deployments (robomp, etc.) get inference auth without ever holding access tokens or the broker bearer.

### Changed

- Changed TTSR `interruptMode` semantics so a non-interrupting decision on a tool-source match now folds the rule reminder into that specific tool's `toolResult` content instead of queuing a loop-wide deferred follow-up turn. Text/thinking matches keep the previous deferred-injection behavior.

### Fixed

- Fixed streaming API requests to recover from provider auth errors by invalidating stale credentials and retrying with a fresh key
- Fixed `auth-broker` migration, `auth-gateway` startup, and `discoverAuthStorage` to fail fast with a clear error when the broker snapshot endpoint returns a non-200 response
- Fixed `omp auth-broker migrate` to skip local placeholder `<authenticated>` API credentials (not real keys) when exporting to a remote broker
- Fixed `auth-gateway` token initialization to avoid clobbering an existing token when multiple processes initialize it concurrently
- Fixed `omp auth-gateway` request handling to reject unsupported OpenAI/Anthropic protocol controls with 400 instead of accepting and ignoring them, propagate upstream error/abort terminal states as failures, preserve Responses reasoning and completed text items, accept string/system Responses messages, and keep Anthropic tool-result ordering valid.
- Fixed gateway usage reporting to include cached-token totals for OpenAI Chat/Responses and to serve the last good cached report during transient upstream usage fetch failures.
- Fixed auth-gateway request cancellation for requests that are already aborted before dispatch.
- Fixed `/login` and `/logout` provider selector overflowing tall provider lists off-screen on small terminals. The selector now scrolls a 10-item window centered on the highlighted entry, shows a `(n/total)` indicator when windowed, and accepts PageUp/PageDown for faster navigation.

### Fixed

- Fixed `.env` loading so malformed variable names and NUL-containing values are ignored before they can poison `Bun.env` and break bash/external process execution with `nul byte found in provided data`.

## [15.1.2] - 2026-05-15
### Fixed

- Fixed SSH host additions/removals made inside a running session not refreshing the live `ssh` tool. `/ssh add` and `/ssh remove` now update the model-visible host list immediately, while `/reload-plugins` and `/move` refresh SSH discovery for external or project-scope config changes without restart.
- Fixed loose object output schemas in `YieldTool` so non-strict schemas (for example `additionalProperties: true`) are preserved and accepted instead of being forced into strict mode
- Fixed unconstrained output schema modes (`outputSchema: true` or absent/non-strict schemas) to run in loose mode for successful results
- Fixed bash tool calls with `pty: true` hanging indefinitely on Windows by falling back to the non-PTY executor instead of entering the ConPTY-backed interactive path. ([#1103](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1103))

### Changed

- Updated MCP and theme schema metadata to reference JSON Schema draft-2020-12

## [15.1.0] - 2026-05-15
### Breaking Changes

- Changed the extension and hook runtime API by moving schema typing from direct TypeBox imports to `TSchema` from `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai`, requiring callers who use TypeScript imports of `Type` to migrate via provided injected modules

### Added

- Added a cancellable handoff progress indicator in `/handoff` that displays while handoff generation runs and can be aborted with `Esc`
- Added `apiKey` as a supported provider override field in model config, allowing API-key-only overrides to provide fallback credentials for built-in models
- Added `supportsMultipleSystemMessages`, `allowsSyntheticReasoningContentForToolCalls`, `disableReasoningOnToolChoice`, and `levels` model-thinking compatibility fields to model configuration schemas
- Added `zod` to the Extension, Custom Tool, Hook, and Custom Command APIs as `pi.zod` so extension and plugin authors can define tool schemas with Zod without separate imports
- Added `pi.zod` as a canonical schema API for examples and extension plugins while keeping `typebox` available as legacy compatibility
- Added a `telemetry` option to `createAgentSession` for passing OpenTelemetry configuration through to the underlying Agent

### Changed

- Changed handoff generation to run as a one-shot handoff request and switch to the new session only after it completes, avoiding an extra assistant handoff turn in chat history
- Changed `pi.typebox.Type.Composite` to merge all object schemas in the provided list, enabling more than two object inputs
- Changed `pi.typebox.Type.Record` to validate record keys against the provided key schema instead of forcing string keys
- Changed `pi.typebox.Type.Array` with `uniqueItems: true` to reject duplicate items while preserving the constraint in wire schemas
- Changed `pi.typebox.Type.Object` with `additionalProperties: false` to reject unknown properties during parsing
- Changed `pi.typebox.Type.Enum` in the compatibility shim to preserve numeric TypeScript enum values
- Changed tool parameter schemas across the agent to use the shared Pi schema pipeline (`TSchema` plus Zod/JSON Schema validation) instead of direct AJV/TypeBox compilation for stricter schema validation compatibility
- Changed GitHub tool input schema shape to expose operation fields in a flat schema form without legacy `run_watch`-style nesting
- Changed Python session pooling to remove the previous 4-session retention cap and 5-minute idle-session eviction, so kernels now stay alive for a session until explicitly disposed via `disposeKernelSessionsByOwner` or `disposeAllKernelSessions`
- Changed kernel cleanup behavior to avoid automatic eviction by idle timeout and capacity pressure, so additional Python sessions are not queued behind retained-session shutdown retries
- Replaced the bundled `@sinclair/typebox` runtime dependency with an in-repo Zod-backed shim exposed through `pi.typebox.Type.*`. Common builders (`Object`, `String`, `Number`, `Integer`, `Boolean`, `Array`, `Tuple`, `Union`, `Intersect`, `Literal`, `Enum`, `Optional`, `Nullable`, `Record`, `Partial`, `Required`, `Pick`, `Omit`, `Composite`, …) keep their existing call signatures but now return Zod schemas that flow through the same validation/wire pipeline as `pi.zod`. Bare `@sinclair/typebox` imports inside extensions are transparently remapped to the same shim by the runtime plugin shim, so plugins that authored against `import { Type } from "@sinclair/typebox"` keep working unchanged. Plugins that relied on TypeBox-only submodule APIs (`@sinclair/typebox/compiler`, `@sinclair/typebox/value`, `TypeRegistry`, the `Symbol(TypeBox.Kind)` marker) must vendor `@sinclair/typebox` in their own package — only the root import is remapped.

### Deprecated

- Deprecated direct TypeBox-only examples for plugin schemas by updating example documentation to prefer `pi.zod`

### Fixed

- Fixed auto-triggered handoff flow to perform only a single handoff-generation model call instead of an extra prompt cycle
- Fixed handoff cancellation behavior so a pre-cancelled signal returns `Handoff cancelled` without starting generation and aborting handoff now propagates through the handoff request signal
- Fixed `create_conventional_analysis` parsing to ignore harmless extra fields and still parse the required conventional fields
- Fixed BashTool async request validation flow so async execution remains disabled and returns the explicit `Async bash execution is disabled` error
- Fixed `task.simple` invalid `schema` and `context` argument handling to still reject unsupported fields after tool-argument validation
- Fixed subagent execution hangs by enforcing `task.maxRuntimeMs` as a wall-clock limit even when inference streaming stalls, so stuck subagents now abort and report runtime-limit exceeded
- Fixed tool schema compatibility validation by routing TypeBox schemas through shared conversion and Zod-based validation to avoid strict-schema provider mismatches
- Fixed Python execution cancellation and timeouts by escalating to kernel shutdown if `SIGINT` did not terminate a running cell within 2 seconds, preventing indefinite hangs in queued or stuck sessions
- Fixed cleanup blocking during long-running executions by forcing a kernel shutdown path when interrupt-based cancellation is ignored
- Fixed bash output emitting a spurious `[… 0 lines elided (NB) …]` marker (and reordering the artifact link before the command output) when the shell minimizer rewrote a small command's output. After `OutputSink.replace()` swapped the minimized text into the buffer, the subsequent `sink.push("[raw output: artifact://N]\n")` chunk was funneled back into the (now empty) head-retention window while the pre-replace `#totalBytes` still tracked the original raw stream — so `dump()` composed `<head=artifact-link> + <middle-elision marker against stale totals> + <tail=minimized text>` instead of `<minimized text> + <artifact link>`. `replace()` now realigns `#totalBytes`/`#totalLines`/`#sawData`/`#truncated` to the authoritative buffer and disables head retention for the lifetime of the sink, so further pushes append to the tail buffer in order. The bash executor also drops the leading `\n` on the artifact-link push when the minimized text already ends with one so the separator stays single-newline.
- Fixed legacy plugin extensions failing to load on Windows when they import a bare-specifier dependency from their own `node_modules` (e.g. `import YAML from "yaml"` in `supipowers`). The legacy-pi mirror resolved the dependency to its absolute path and then ran the path through `isUrlLikeSpecifier`, whose `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z\d+.-]*:` regex matched the Windows drive letter (`C:`) and short-circuited the `pathToFileURL` conversion. The raw path was emitted into the mirrored TS source as `import x from "C:\\Users\\...\\dep\\dist\\index.js"`, where `\n`, `\U`, `\y` and other backslash sequences were eaten by the TS string-literal parser, producing nonsense package specifiers like `C:Usersjames.ompagentextensionssupipowers\node_modulesyamldistindex.js` that Bun's resolver rejected with `Cannot find package …`. `isUrlLikeSpecifier` now rejects `^[A-Za-z]:[\\/]` first, so Windows absolute paths flow through `pathToFileURL` like every other absolute path and reach the mirror as proper `file:///C:/...` URLs.
- Fixed Python session queued executions silently resurrecting kernels after `disposeAllKernelSessions` or `disposeKernelSessionsByOwner` removed the session: queued work now checks the session is still registered before replacing or executing on a kernel and rejects with cancellation otherwise
- Fixed Python session disposal treating an unconfirmed `PythonKernel.shutdown()` result as success: sessions whose kernel shutdown returns `{ confirmed: false }` (or rejects) are now retained in the registry and a `warn` is logged so a later dispose can retry instead of orphaning the subprocess
- Fixed `task.maxRuntimeMs` losing wall-clock aborts that fired during pre-prompt session setup by re-checking the abort signal immediately before issuing the model prompt, so a stalled subagent now exits with the runtime-limit reason instead of hanging through setup races
- Fixed late `yield` events landing after a wall-clock timeout from flipping a timed-out subagent to a successful exit, so the reported `aborted` flag and exit code now always reflect the runtime-limit breach while yield payloads remain in `extractedToolData`
- Fixed async-task progress consumer to copy `contextTokens` and `contextWindow` from the completed `SingleResult` onto `AgentProgress`, so UI gauges keep showing per-turn context after a backgrounded task finishes
- Fixed the status-line `path` segment ignoring `stripWorkPrefix: false` when selecting the folder icon for scratch directories. The icon selection now respects the same gate as the scratch path stripping, so disabling `stripWorkPrefix` keeps the regular `folder` icon even when the project directory is inside a scratch root.
- Fixed `YieldTool` constructor to fall back to the loose record schema when the session `outputSchema` contains unresolved `$ref` strings (e.g. external or cyclic references that survive dereferencing), instead of installing a validator that would reject every payload with an unresolved-reference error
- Fixed `pi.typebox.Type.String` dropping `minLength`/`maxLength`/`pattern` constraints when a `format` (e.g. `email`, `url`, `uuid`) was also supplied; length and pattern checks are now applied to the format-specific schema instead of being gated on an `instanceof z.ZodString` check that never matched the format subclasses.
- Fixed `pi.typebox.Type.Object` stripping unknown properties when constructed without explicit `additionalProperties`. TypeBox preserves extras by default, so the shim now installs `.loose()` for the omitted/`true` cases while keeping `.strict()` for `additionalProperties: false` and `.catchall(schema)` for a schema value.

## [15.0.2] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- Added the `set_host_uri_schemes` RPC command so hosts can register and replace writable/read-only internal URI schemes with scheme metadata (`writable`, `immutable`) at runtime
- Enabled the `write` tool to dispatch `write(url, content)` to registered internal URL handlers, allowing edits to non-filesystem resources via host-managed URI schemes
- Added host-owned internal URI read/write over RPC, including abort support, so URI operations are resolved by the host transport for `read` and `write` requests
- Added handling of host URI request results in RPC mode so host services can stream completion frames for internal URI operations
- Added scratch-directory awareness to the status-line `path` segment. When the project directory is inside an OS-level scratch root (the platform `os.tmpdir()`, `/tmp` and `/var/tmp` plus their macOS `/private/...` aliases, `~/tmp`, or — on Windows — `%TEMP%` / `%TMP%` / `%SystemRoot%\Temp`), the segment now (1) renders the new `icon.scratchFolder` symbol instead of `icon.folder`, and (2) strips the scratch root from the displayed path so only the trailing folder (and any subpath beneath it) is shown — mirroring how `/work` and `~/Projects` are already abbreviated. Both behaviors honor the existing `stripWorkPrefix` option. Icon defaults: 🗑 (emoji), `` (nf-fa-trash) for Nerd Font, `[T]` for ASCII, `◌` in the poimandres themes; themes can override `icon.scratchFolder` independently of `icon.folder`.

### Changed

- Changed the `github` tool's search ops (`search_issues`, `search_prs`, `search_code`, `search_commits`) to default the `repo` scope to the current checkout's `owner/repo` when `repo` is omitted. The auto-scope is skipped when the query already carries an explicit `repo:`/`org:`/`user:`/`owner:` qualifier or when `gh repo view` cannot resolve a github remote (in which case the search proceeds across all of GitHub as before). `search_repos` is unchanged — repository-scoping there must live in the query.

- Changed bash command preprocessing to strip trailing `| head` and `| tail` pipelines (including `|&`) from each top-level segment in command chains separated by `;`, `&&`, `||`, or `&`
- Changed bash fixup notices to state that stderr is already merged into stdout and to reflect that fixes were applied for multiple stripped segments when several transforms fire
- Changed shell-minimizer per-line truncation marker from a bare `…` to `…[+N]`, where `N` is the count of dropped Unicode scalars. The bracketed tally disambiguates minimizer-driven cuts from genuine `…` characters in the source (paths, JSON, stack traces, etc.) and gives the agent an exact count so it can decide whether the missing tail is recoverable inline or warrants reading the `[raw output: artifact://<id>]` footer the bash wrapper already emits when the minimizer rewrites output. Affects pipeline Stage 5 (`truncate_lines_at` in `defs/*.toml`) and the internal callers in `filters/git.rs`, `filters/listing.rs`, and `filters/lint.rs`. ([#1046](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1046))
- Changed bash command preprocessing to use the real `brush-parser` AST via `pi-natives` `applyBashFixups` instead of a hand-rolled top-level mask scanner. The previous regex/character-walking implementation reimplemented quote/heredoc/`$(...)` tracking with conservative bail-outs (notably refusing to fixup commands containing here-strings); the AST-driven version inherits the full shell parser, so semantics-preserving rewrites like stripping `| head -5` off `cat <<<'content' | head -5` now succeed instead of being skipped. No public API change — `applyBashFixups(command)` returns the same `{ command, stripped }` shape.

### Fixed

- Fixed hashline pure inserts to drop a single echoed anchor line when `edit.hashlineAutoDropPureInsertDuplicates` is enabled and `+ ANCHOR` payloads start with the anchor line or `< ANCHOR` payloads end with it, while preserving intentional single-line duplicates by default. ([#1090](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1090))
- Fixed bash command fixups to remove a redundant standalone trailing `2>&1` redirect when no other pipe or redirection remains
- Fixed command-fixup notices to list all stripped segments instead of reporting only one
- Fixed summarized `read` output stalling agents on elided regions by appending an explicit footer like `[NN lines across MM elided regions; read <path>:raw or a line range like <path>:1-9999 for verbatim content]`. The footer fires whenever the structural summarizer elided at least one span, so the model gets a concrete recovery selector instead of having to guess from a bare `...` / `{ .. }` marker. Surfaces `elidedLines` on `ReadToolDetails.summary` alongside the existing `elidedSpans`. ([#1046](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1046))
- Updated the `read` tool prompt to describe the new elision footer and instruct the model to follow `:raw` (or an explicit line range) when the elided body is actually needed, rather than guessing.
- Fixed plugin extensions failing to load when their `peerDependencies` reference internal `pi-*` packages under any scope other than `@mariozechner` (e.g. `Cannot find module '@earendil-works/pi-tui'` from `@juicesharp/rpiv-ask-user-question`, or `Cannot find module '@oh-my-pi/pi-utils'` from `@oh-my-pi/swarm-extension`). The legacy-pi specifier shim now treats `@mariozechner`, `@earendil-works`, **and** the canonical `@oh-my-pi` itself as aliases for the same set of bundled in-process packages (`pi-agent-core`, `pi-ai`, `pi-coding-agent`, `pi-natives`, `pi-tui`, `pi-utils`), and additionally rewrites the upstream-only `pi-ai/oauth` subpath onto our `pi-ai/utils/oauth` layout. Restored the `Key` runtime helper export on `@oh-my-pi/pi-tui` to match upstream — plugins using `Key.enter` / `Key.ctrl("c")` (e.g. `@plannotator/pi-extension`, `@juicesharp/rpiv-ask-user-question`) no longer fail with `Export named 'Key' not found`. End-to-end verified against `@juicesharp/rpiv-ask-user-question`, `@oh-my-pi/swarm-extension`, and `@plannotator/pi-extension` — each now loads cleanly with all of its tools/commands/handlers registered. Plugins importing any of those scopes are remapped to the omp binary's own copy at load time, so peer deps are no longer dragged in from npm and there is exactly one module instance per package regardless of which scope name the plugin's manifest happened to declare.
- Fixed `omp commit` hanging after a successful commit instead of returning to the shell. The command now mirrors the `runPrintMode` exit pattern and calls `postmortem.quit(0)` once the pipeline resolves so lingering HTTP/2 keep-alive sockets, the Settings autosave timer, and other AgentSession background handles don't keep the event loop pinned. ([#1041](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1041))
- Fixed hashline payload parsing to silently treat truly-blank lines as empty `~`-prefixed payload lines when more payload follows in the same run. The previous behavior broke at the blank ("payload line has no preceding +, <, or = operation.") even though the intent is obvious — the only ambiguity is between in-payload blanks and end-of-section blanks, and a one-line lookahead resolves it: blanks that precede a non-payload op still end the run cleanly as section separators. Recovers the common case of forgetting the leading separator on a blank inserted line without changing how trailing blanks between ops behave.
- Rewrote the hashline edit prompt examples to use an ASCII-only `TITLE = "Mr"` → `"Mrs"` / `"Dr"` motif instead of the previous `" • "` and `"·"` separators. Some agents had been copying the middle-dot literal characters into real edits as if they were format scaffolding (e.g. emitting payload lines like `~	·`), since the demo inserts were near-twins of the existing string. The new example keeps every original op shape (single-line replace, multiline replace, insert AFTER/BEFORE, append, delete, blank, plus both anti-patterns) but uses content that is obviously domain-specific and clearly distinct from any payload separator. Pure prompt change; no parser, schema, or runtime behavior is affected.
- Fixed startup fallback-chain validation to recognize cached runtime-discovered standard provider models, including Ollama Cloud models listed by `--list-models`, so `retry.fallbackChains` no longer warns that valid `ollama-cloud/<model>` selectors are unknown. ([#1052](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1052))
- Fixed `discoverAgents()` ignoring `disabledProviders` for the `claude-plugins` provider. Plugin roots from `~/.claude/plugins/` were scanned unconditionally, so agents from Claude Code marketplace plugins continued to appear in `/agents` and the Agent Control Center even when `disabledProviders: [claude-plugins]` was set. The discovery path now checks `isProviderEnabled("claude-plugins")` before calling `listClaudePluginRoots()`, matching how every other capability respects the disabled-providers set. ([#1075](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1075))

### Fixed

- Fixed `$env:VAR` PowerShell variables being mangled on Windows when commands invoked PowerShell as a subprocess (e.g. `powershell -Command "Write-Host $env:SystemRoot"`). Brush-core applied POSIX parameter expansion to `$env` before spawning the child, leaving a dangling `:NAME`. The fix lives in `pi-shell` at env-var application time: every brush session now defines `env=$env` as an internal shell variable so `$env:NAME` expands to the literal `$env:NAME` token that PowerShell expects. The fallback is not exported, only influences brush's own expansion, and is shadowed by any user assignment to `env` (e.g. `env=prod; echo "$env:8080"` still prints `prod:8080`), so the POSIX bash contract is preserved. ([#1079](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1079))


## [15.0.1] - 2026-05-14
### Breaking Changes

- Removed the dedicated `exit_plan_mode` tool and its prompt, requiring plan-mode completion to use the existing `resolve` tool path instead

### Added

- Added optional `extra` metadata object to the `resolve` tool so callers can pass context-specific payloads, including plan approval titles
- Added `hide: true` frontmatter option for skill `SKILL.md` files. Hidden skills are still loaded and remain reachable via `skill://<name>` URLs and (when enabled) `/skill:<name>` slash commands, but are omitted from the rendered system prompt's `<skills>` listing so the model won't auto-discover them. Use for skills the user opts into explicitly rather than ones the model should pick up from descriptions.
- Added middle elision for streaming tool outputs (bash, ssh, python, js eval) and post-execution tool result spill. When `tools.artifactHeadBytes` is set (default 20 KB), large outputs now keep both the first N KB and the last N KB with an inline `[… N lines elided (M KB) …]` marker between them, instead of dropping everything before the trailing tail. Setting `tools.artifactHeadBytes = 0` reverts to the previous tail-only behavior. The full output is still mirrored to the session artifact (`artifact://<id>`) regardless of elision mode. Exposes `truncateMiddle` and `formatMiddleElisionMarker` from `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent/session/streaming-output`, extends `OutputSinkOptions` with `headBytes`, and adds `direction: "middle"` plus `headRange` / `tailRange` / `elidedLines` / `elidedBytes` to `TruncationMeta`.
- Added per-line column cap shared across streaming tool outputs (`bash`, `ssh`, `python`, `js eval`) and the `read` tool. Lines wider than `tools.outputMaxColumns` bytes (default **768**) are ellipsis-truncated at write time and remaining bytes up to the next `\n` are dropped — bounded memory even on multi-MB single-line outputs (e.g. `cat /dev/urandom`). The cap lives on `OutputSink` as the new `maxColumns` option, persists state across chunk boundaries so split-mid-line writes still respect the budget, and exposes `columnDroppedBytes` / `columnTruncatedLines` on `OutputSummary`. Middle-elision byte math subtracts column drops so the "elided from middle" count stays honest. `read` reuses the same setting but trims its already-collected lines via `truncateLine`. Skipped when the read selector is `:raw`. The artifact file (`artifact://<id>`) keeps the full uncapped stream. Set `tools.outputMaxColumns = 0` to disable.
- Added Bun HTTP/2 fetch opt-in. Dev scripts (`bun run dev`, `bun run stats`) now pass `bun --experimental-http2-fetch` so every `fetch()` advertises `h2` in the TLS ALPN list and falls back to HTTP/1.1 when the server doesn't select it. Multiplexing collapses parallel requests to the same origin onto one TLS connection. For the installed `omp` binary, export `BUN_FEATURE_FLAG_EXPERIMENTAL_HTTP2_CLIENT=1` in your shell to enable the same behavior (the flag has to be set before Bun starts; `process.env` from inside JS is too late). Requires Bun **1.3.14**.
- Added per-subagent cost display (`$X.XX` in the task progress tree and the session-observer stats line). Cost is accumulated incrementally from `message_end` events and shown only when non-zero, using the `statusLineCost` theme color. Providers that do not report per-turn cost data (e.g. subscription/OAuth usage) continue to show nothing.
- Added ACP elicitation bridge so skills/extensions calling `select`, `confirm`, or `input` on the extension UI context now produce real `unstable_createElicitation` form requests to the ACP client (rather than always resolving to `undefined` / `false`). The `acpExtensionUiContext` constant is promoted to `createAcpExtensionUiContext(connection, getSessionId, clientCapabilities)` — invoked once per session inside `#configureExtensions`, with `getSessionId: () => string` so the live `record.session.sessionId` is read on every elicitation (the underlying id mutates when an extension command calls `ctx.newSession` / `ctx.switchSession`). Each method maps to a single-property `value` schema: `select` → `{type: "string", enum}`, `confirm` → `{type: "boolean"}` (joined `title` + `message` when the trimmed message is non-empty; otherwise just `title`), `input` → `{type: "string", description: placeholder?}` (ACP has no `placeholder` field on `StringPropertySchema`; empty / whitespace-only placeholders are treated as absent). `accept` responses narrow the returned `ElicitationContentValue` back to the method's declared type with a runtime `typeof` guard; `decline` / `cancel` / transport failures fall back to the prior stub return values. `dialogOptions.signal` is honored: an already-aborted signal short-circuits before any SDK round-trip, and an abort mid-flight races against the elicitation so the caller's promise resolves to the stub fallback (the ACP request itself keeps running on the client side — the SDK exposes no form-mode cancel surface; `unstable_completeElicitation` is URL-mode only — matching the in-flight pattern used by `requestRpcEditor`). `dialogOptions.timeout` is honored on parity with `RpcExtensionUIContext`: when the timer fires before the client responds, `onTimeout` is invoked and the caller resolves to the stub fallback. A throwing `onTimeout` is caught and logged (`logger.warn`) so the elicitation promise still settles. Late SDK rejections that arrive after abort/timeout are dropped silently to keep operator logs clean; transport failures still emit `logger.warn` with `{ sessionId, method, error }`. Calls are skipped when the client did not advertise `clientCapabilities.elicitation.form` during `initialize`, so non-elicitation clients are unaffected. `createAcpExtensionUiContext` is exported for tests.

### Changed

- Changed plan-mode completion to use `resolve { action: "apply", reason, extra: { title } }` to request plan approval rather than calling `exit_plan_mode`
- Changed resolve pending-action previews to trim and truncate long `reason` text for cleaner status-line rendering
- Raised the image downscaling default JPEG quality from 75 to 80 in `resizeImage` output generation
- Changed image resize metadata notes from coordinate-scale hints to a simple `Image resized from <original> to <displayed>` message and hide the note when the resized dimensions are unchanged
- Removed `utils/image-convert.ts` and its `convertToPng` helper; callers now inline `new Bun.Image(bytes).png().toBase64()` from [`Bun.Image`](https://bun.com/docs/runtime/image) (Bun 1.3.14+).
- Changed image decode/resize/encode in `utils/image-resize.ts` from the native `PhotonImage` binding to [`Bun.Image`](https://bun.com/docs/runtime/image). Same PNG/JPEG/WebP quality+dimension ladder, but pipelines run off-thread on Bun's statically-linked codecs with no native-addon round-trip. Bumped the minimum Bun runtime requirement to **1.3.14**.
- Changed `search` pagination in multi-file scopes so `skip` now skips entire files and pages results in groups of up to 20 files, with output guiding the next `skip` value via `Showing files X-Y of N`
- Changed multi-file search result selection to cap each file at 20 matches and round-robin across files, so one noisy file no longer suppresses visibility of hits in other files and truncation now reports per-file limits
- Changed search truncation metadata/renderer output from match/result-based limits to file-based limits (`fileLimitReached`, `perFileLimitReached`) and updated truncation labels accordingly
- Lowered `read.defaultLimit` default from `500` to `300` lines, and split the per-range context padding into asymmetric `RANGE_LEADING_CONTEXT_LINES = 1` / `RANGE_TRAILING_CONTEXT_LINES = 3` (was symmetric `RANGE_CONTEXT_LINES = 3`). Replay analysis over post-summarizer sessions (`scripts/session-stats/optimize_read_config.py`) showed that bare-path reads are over-provisioned at the median (file p50 = 220 lines) and that most follow-up reads are disjoint hops rather than adjacent extensions — so a smaller default plus narrower leading context reclaims tokens without measurably changing first-cover rate. Trailing context stays at 3 lines to keep anchor-stale recovery on narrow reads. Explicit `read.defaultLimit` overrides in settings are honoured unchanged.

### Fixed

- Fixed abrupt process termination data loss during session persistence by moving steady-state session writes to a synchronous path that writes each entry to the kernel page cache before returning
- Fixed `--help` startup to avoid a config/model-registry load cycle so the root CLI help command now exits successfully in a clean environment
- Queued `/skill:<name> [args]` invocations now show as compact `Steer: /skill:<name> [args]` / `Follow-up: /skill:<name> [args]` chips in the pending-messages bar and disappear when the agent consumes the queued message (parity with plain-text steer/follow-up). Previously the queued skill was invisible while queued and rendered as a full skill block at consumption with no chip ever appearing.
- Plan-mode "Approve and compact context" no longer surfaces a red "Operation aborted" line on the plan-mode assistant message; the silent transition into compaction now renders cleanly on both live and replay paths. Real user-cancel aborts on unrelated turns and the existing "Compaction cancelled" path are unchanged.
- Auto-recover conflict-resolution `write`/`read` paths that the agent malformed as `<file>:conflict://<N>` (or `<file>:conflict://*`) by mixing the `:conflicts` read selector with the `conflict://` scheme. The stripped `<file>:` prefix is stored on `ParsedConflictUri.recoveredPrefix` and, for writes, surfaces as a trailing note in the result text so the agent learns the correct shape. Clean `conflict://…` URIs are unchanged.
- Fixed hashline edit renderer leaving a stray `@` in the displayed file path when the agent emitted a canonical `@@ PATH` header (or any `@`-run longer than one). Titles like `Edit: @ packages/foo.ts` now render as `Edit: packages/foo.ts`, matching the actual parser in `hashline/input.ts` which already strips every leading `@` before resolving the path. Purely cosmetic — the edit itself was always routed to the correct file.
- Fixed model contextWindow and maxTokens defaulting to `UNK_CONTEXT_WINDOW` (222222) / `UNK_MAX_TOKENS` (8888) when cached or freshly-discovered provider models replace bundled models through `ModelRegistry.#mergeResolvedModels`. The merge now preserves the bundled model's values when the replacement only has sentinel fallbacks.
- Fixed headless `browser.open` tab startup on slow Chromium target enumeration by making worker-side stealth user-agent target setup selective, bounded, and best-effort for non-active targets. Worker startup errors are now surfaced directly instead of degrading into the generic tab worker initialization timeout.
- Fixed token display for sessions and subagents inflating far beyond the context window. `token_total` status-line segment and the subagent overlay token counter now show `input + output + cacheWrite` instead of `input + output + cacheRead + cacheWrite`. With prompt caching, `cacheRead` per turn equals the full cached context — summing it across all turns produces a cumulative total that is N×context_size (e.g. a 5-turn session with a 1 M-token context reported ~5 M tokens). Cache activity is still visible via the dedicated `cache_read`/`cache_write` status-line segments; billing cost is unaffected.
- Fixed ACP clients missing `config_option_update` notifications when the thinking level changed via any path other than the client's own `session/set_session_config_option` call (slash commands, model auto-adjust, extension UI). `AgentSession` now emits a `thinking_level_changed` event from `setThinkingLevel`, and `AcpAgent` subscribes to each managed session for the session's lifetime and pushes a fresh `config_option_update` whenever the effective level changes — independent of any active prompt turn. The subscription is installed inside `#scheduleBootstrapUpdates`'s 50 ms timer so it shares the same race guard that prevents Zed's `Received session notification for unknown session` drop when notifications fire before `session/new` (or fork) returns; the pre-bootstrap thinking level is reported in the response's `configOptions`. The `session/set_session_config_option` handler keeps its own push only when the subscription has not yet been installed, so client-driven thinking changes still notify pre-bootstrap, post-bootstrap they flow through the subscription exactly once. Subscriptions are released in `#disposeSessionRecord`.
- Fixed MCP OAuth refresh failing with `HTTP 401 invalid_client` for servers that require Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591) and have no `oauth.clientId` configured (e.g. `mcp.linear.app`). `MCPOAuthFlow` registered a fresh public PKCE client on each authorize and discarded the issued `client_id` once the flow object went out of scope; refresh then called the provider's `/token` endpoint without a `client_id`. The flow now exposes `resolvedClientId` / `registeredClientSecret` getters, `MCPCommandController#handleOAuthFlow` returns them alongside `credentialId`, and both the initial-connect and `/mcp reauth` paths persist them into `auth.{clientId,clientSecret}` (used at refresh) and `oauth.{clientId,clientSecret}` (used by subsequent `/mcp reauth` to skip re-registration). The `MCPAddWizard` `onOAuth` callback type is now `Promise<MCPAddWizardOAuthResult>` and `#launchOAuthFlow` folds the registered credentials into wizard state. Servers with a statically-configured `oauth.clientId` (Notion, Slack, Datadog) are unaffected — `#tryRegisterClient` short-circuits and the write-back is a no-op. ([#1061](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/1061) by [@ldx](https://github.com/ldx)).

## [15.0.0] - 2026-05-13
### Breaking Changes

- Removed `op: issue_view` and `op: pr_view` from the `github` tool. Read single issues/PRs via the `read` tool against `issue://<N>` / `pr://<N>` (or the long form `issue://<owner>/<repo>/<N>` / `pr://<owner>/<repo>/<N>`); append `?comments=0` to drop the comments section. The `issue` and `comments` parameters were removed from the tool schema since no remaining op consumes them. Mutating ops (`pr_create`, `pr_checkout`, `pr_push`), `repo_view`, `search_*`, and `run_watch` are unchanged.
- Removed `op: pr_diff` (along with the `nameOnly` and `exclude` schema fields) from the `github` tool. Read PR diffs through the new `pr://` URL family: `pr://<N>/diff` for the changed-file listing, `pr://<N>/diff/<i>` for a single file slice (1-indexed), and `pr://<N>/diff/all` for the verbatim unified diff. Long-form `pr://<owner>/<repo>/<N>/diff[/…]` works the same way. All three variants share one `gh pr diff` invocation through a new `pr-diff` cache row, so the listing and per-file slices reconstruct from cached bytes without re-shelling. Diff content is served as `text/plain` so the `read` tool's line selectors (e.g. `pr://<N>/diff/all:200-400`) page the cached output without falsely advertising hashline anchors.
- Renamed ACP custom extension methods from `omp/*` to `_omp/*` to comply with the ACP spec's `_`-prefix requirement for non-spec methods; existing callers must update method names

### Added

- Added markdown rendering for `read` results when content type is `text/markdown`, so GitHub internal-URL outputs are shown as formatted markdown instead of plain code blocks
- Added `pr://<N>/diff`, `pr://<N>/diff/<i>`, and `pr://<N>/diff/all` internal-URL shapes covering changed-file listings, per-file slices, and the full unified diff. They share one `pr-diff` SQLite cache row with the same TTL knobs as `pr://<N>` views (`github.cache.softTtlSec` / `github.cache.hardTtlSec` / `github.cache.enabled`). Single PR views now advertise the diff entry point via a `Diff: pr://<owner>/<repo>/<N>/diff` note. Cache schema bumped to `user_version = 3`; older rows are dropped on first open to add credential-scoped keys and relax the `kind` CHECK constraint.
- Added `issue://` / `pr://` internal-URL schemes that share a SQLite-backed cache with the rest of the `github` tool. Single-item reads (`issue://<N>`, `issue://<owner>/<repo>/<N>`) return rendered markdown and within `github.cache.softTtlSec` (default 5 minutes) skip the `gh` round-trip entirely; within `github.cache.hardTtlSec` (default 7 days) the cached row is returned and a background refresh is scheduled. Root and repo-scoped reads (`issue://`, `pr://owner/repo`) issue a live `gh issue list` / `gh pr list` for browsing, supporting `?state=open|closed|all` for issues, `?state=open|closed|merged|all` for PRs, and `?limit=`, `?author=`, `?label=` query params. Rendered output lands in `~/.omp/cache/github-cache.db` (override via `OMP_GITHUB_CACHE_DB`); disable the cache entirely with `github.cache.enabled = false`. Cwd→default-repo lookups (`gh repo view`) are memoized per-process.
- Added new `Approve and compact context` choice to the ExitPlanMode approval selector. Sits between `Approve and execute` (purge session) and `Approve and keep context` (full transcript) — runs `/compact` on the plan-mode transcript with a planning-specific summarization hint, then dispatches the plan-approved execution turn so it lands on a fresh cache anchor with the summarized rationale carried over. Cancelling the compaction (Esc or any other abort source) defers the execution dispatch and surfaces a warning so the operator can resubmit manually; non-abort failures proceed best-effort.
- Added `CompactionCancelledError` typed sentinel and `CompactionOutcome` (`"ok" | "cancelled" | "failed"`) return type to `@oh-my-pi/pi-agent-core/compaction`. `CommandController.executeCompaction` and `handleCompactCommand` now return the outcome instead of `void` so callers can discriminate user-driven aborts from generic failures without inspecting error messages.
- Added a `credential_disabled` extension event so extensions can subscribe via `pi.on("credential_disabled", handler)` and react when `AuthStorage` automatically soft-disables a credential (e.g. OAuth `invalid_grant`). Replaces the current `agent_end` errorMessage regex pattern downstream extensions have to match against. Handler payload is `{ type, provider, disabledCause }`. `createAgentSession()` subscribes the per-session extension runner to the shared `AuthStorage` via `authStorage.onCredentialDisabled(...)` at the very top of session creation — before any startup model probes run — so events fire on every disable regardless of whether the embedder also has a constructor `onCredentialDisabled` handler attached. The SDK forwards through `ExtensionRunner.emitCredentialDisabled(event)`, which buffers events until `runner.initialize(...)` runs in the mode controller and then flushes them through `emit()` so extension handlers see populated UI/runtime context (rather than the constructor's no-op default with `hasUI=false`, an unset model, and no-op runtime actions). On `session.dispose()` the subscription is unsubscribed; the embedder's constructor-attached listener keeps firing through its own permanent subscription. The outer `createAgentSession()` catch also releases the subscription if startup throws before the dispose-wrap is wired, so repeated retries don't accumulate dead listeners.
- Added `omp acp` subcommand for launching as an ACP (Agent Client Protocol) server over stdio
- Added explicit `type` discriminators to ACP `initialize` auth methods, including a `terminal` setup method gated on `clientCapabilities.auth.terminal`
- Added ACP equivalents for the remaining TUI slash commands (`/jobs`, `/changelog`, `/dump`, `/copy`, `/hotkeys`, `/extensions`, `/agents`, `/model`, `/plan`, `/loop`, `/btw`, `/login`, `/logout`, `/resume`, `/tree`, `/branch`, `/new`, `/drop`, `/handoff`, `/fork`, `/session delete`, `/export`, `/share`, `/todo`, `/memory`, `/move`, `/mcp`, `/ssh`, `/marketplace`, `/plugins`) so ACP clients reach feature parity with the TUI for non-interactive flows
- Added ACP `plan` mode: when `plan.enabled` setting is on, ACP `session/new`/`load`/`resume`/`fork` advertise a `plan` mode alongside `default`; `session/set_mode` toggles plan-mode state so the next agent turn injects the plan-mode system prompt
- Added ACP `ClientBridge` abstraction (`packages/coding-agent/src/session/client-bridge.ts`) that routes tool I/O through the connected client when capabilities are advertised at `initialize`; populated from `AgentSideConnection` in ACP mode
- Added ACP `terminal/*` routing for `bash`: when the client advertises `terminal: true`, the tool creates a client-side terminal, embeds its `terminalId` on the live tool card, polls output, and releases the handle on exit or abort
- Added ACP `fs/read_text_file` and `fs/write_text_file` routing for the `read` and `write` tools: when the client advertises `fs.readTextFile` / `fs.writeTextFile`, plain-text reads/writes go through the editor (surfacing unsaved buffer content and letting the editor track agent writes); falls back to disk only for reads, throws on bridge write failures
- Added ACP `session/request_permission` gate around `bash`, `edit`, `write`, and `ast_edit` when an ACP client is connected; remembers `allow_always` / `reject_always` decisions per tool for the session lifetime
- Added `diff` `ToolCallContent` emission for edit tool results: per-file `oldText`/`newText` is threaded through `EditToolPerFileResult` / `EditToolDetails` so ACP clients can render inline diffs
- Added richer ACP `StopReason` mapping (`max_tokens`, `refusal`, `cancelled`) derived from the last assistant message's internal stop reason; previously only `end_turn`/`cancelled` were emitted
- Added `_meta.messageCount` and `_meta.size` on `session/list` `SessionInfo` entries
- Added ACP `tool_call_update` `locations` refresh from in-flight tool args and final result details so clients can "follow along" multi-file edits in real time

### Changed

- Changed issue and pull-request list entries to link to repository-qualified URLs (for example `issue://owner/repo/<N>`) so list items open correctly outside the default repo
- Aligned prompt instruction language by defining `NEVER` and `AVOID` as strict aliases for `MUST NOT` and `SHOULD NOT` in the system prompt, and standardized agent, tool, and system prompt templates to use those terms consistently
- Changed `--mode acp` to apply the same stdout-quiet overrides as `--mode rpc` so no banner or status text leaks into the JSON-RPC channel
- Changed ACP startup to no longer require a configured model so registry validators and clients can complete `initialize` and `authenticate` before any model is selected
### Fixed

- Deferred flushing of buffered `credential_disabled` events during extension runner initialization to a microtask so handler failures are now routed through `onError()` registrations made immediately after `initialize()`, preserving extension error reporting
- Fixed `eval` tool dynamic `await import("./relative.ts")` calls failing with `Cannot find module ... from .../eval/js/shared/runtime.ts`. The static-import rewriter only handled `ImportDeclaration` nodes, so dynamic-import call expressions resolved their specifier against the worker module's URL instead of the session cwd. The rewriter now walks the full AST and additionally swaps `import` callees in `CallExpression` nodes for `__omp_import__`, which forwards the optional options bag verbatim to native `import()` so `{ with: { type: "json" } }` round-trips. Renamed `rewriteStaticImports` → `rewriteImports`.
- Fixed `pr://<owner>/<repo>/diff` URLs for repositories named `diff` to continue resolving to PR list lookups instead of being parsed as short-form diff links
- Fixed `issue://<N>/diff` short form previously misparsing as a repo named `<N>/diff` and surfacing a confusing GraphQL "Could not resolve to a Repository" error. The numeric-host disambiguation that already routed `pr://<N>/diff` through the diff path now applies to both schemes, so `issue://<N>/diff[/…]` falls through to the existing "Issue views do not have a diff; use pr://<owner>/<repo>/<n>/diff for pull requests." rejection — matching the long-form `issue://<owner>/<repo>/<N>/diff` behavior. `<scheme>://<owner>/diff` listings for a repo literally named `diff` are unchanged.
- Fixed PR unified diff parsing so changed-file headers with quoted paths (such as paths containing spaces) are now detected correctly and hunk content lines beginning with `---`/`+++` are counted in additions/deletions
- Fixed GitHub view caching to account for active credential identity and avoid serving cached issue/PR data across different account/token contexts
- Fixed `read` call tracking so calls without an explicit path or URL target no longer appear as regular file reads in the execution tracker
- Fixed `createAgentSession()` subscribing the `credential_disabled` bridge to a freshly discovered `AuthStorage` orphan when an embedder supplied only `options.modelRegistry` (no `options.authStorage`). Refresh failures emitted by `modelRegistry.getApiKey()` flow through `modelRegistry.authStorage`, so a divergent local instance silently swallowed every disable event and also leaked into the `mcpManager` and session result. The SDK now reconciles `authStorage` to `modelRegistry.authStorage` up front and rejects mismatched `options.authStorage`/`options.modelRegistry.authStorage` pairs at session construction.
- Fixed `runSubagent` (subagent task executor) carrying the same latent `AuthStorage`/`ModelRegistry` divergence as `createAgentSession()`: when only `options.modelRegistry` was supplied, the executor previously fell through to a fresh `discoverAuthStorage()` and handed that orphan into `createAgentSession()` alongside a registry whose `.authStorage` was a different instance. The executor now reconciles to `modelRegistry.authStorage` before any further work and rejects mismatched `options.authStorage`/`options.modelRegistry.authStorage` pairs the same way the SDK does, so subagents can no longer silently observe a different storage view than their parent.
- Fixed `github` tool's `search_issues`/`search_prs`/`search_code`/`search_commits`/`search_repos` ops always returning 0 results when the query contained more than one qualifier (e.g. `is:merged is:pr`, `is:open author:foo`). `gh search …` since the `advanced_search=true` rollout in gh 2.92 silently wraps multi-token positional queries in parentheses and quotes everything after the first qualifier as that qualifier's value (`is:"merged is:pr"`), which GitHub then matches as a literal state filter that no PR can satisfy. The tool now calls `gh api -X GET /search/<endpoint> -f q=… -F per_page=…` directly so the qualifiers reach GitHub's search API verbatim. `is:issue`/`is:pr` and `repo:<owner>/<repo>` are appended internally to preserve the previous CLI-flag behavior; the user-facing query string in the formatted output is unchanged. `state` for merged PRs is derived from `pull_request.merged_at` so the rendered `State:` line stays `merged`/`closed`/`open` as before.
- Fixed `read` tool renderer rendering failed reads with a success check (`✓`) and styling the error message as file content while the surrounding box was red. The renderer now branches on `isError` for both file and URL paths: header shows `✘ Read <path>` with a proper error icon and the underlying message is rendered as an error line. `renderReadUrlResult` got the same treatment so failed URL reads also get the cross icon instead of falling through to the `"No response data"` Text fallback. Mirrors the `bash`/`find` renderer error pattern.
- Fixed ACP mode to advertise and handle non-TUI builtin slash commands and `/skill:<name>` commands
- Fixed ACP `session/resume` and `session/close` to dispatch correctly under SDK 0.21 by renaming `unstable_resumeSession` / `unstable_closeSession` to the stable `resumeSession` / `closeSession` method names the SDK now routes to
- Fixed ACP `tool_call` / `tool_call_update` `locations` to always emit absolute paths (resolved against the session cwd) so editor clients can reliably open or focus the referenced file
- Fixed ACP edit `diff` metadata for moves to point at the destination path rather than the now-deleted source so post-edit "open file" actions land on the new file
- Fixed ACP `session/request_permission` `locations` to be absolute and to honor the `requestPermission` capability bit instead of only checking for the method, matching the read/write/bash capability gating
- Fixed ACP `authenticate` to reject `methodId` values that were not advertised by `initialize` so malformed clients fail fast instead of being treated as authenticated
- Fixed ACP mode changes made via `session/set_session_config_option` (`MODE_CONFIG_ID`) to also emit a `current_mode_update` notification, matching `session/set_mode` so clients tracking `modes.currentModeId` stay in sync
- Fixed `/model` ACP builtin to emit a `config_option_update` after switching models so clients show the new model in config selectors immediately
- Fixed `/mcp list` (ACP) to redact query strings and userinfo from server URLs before emitting them, so API keys embedded in URLs (e.g. `?exaApiKey=…`) are not leaked to clients
- Fixed `/mcp test|resources|prompts` (ACP) to wire the auth storage before `prepareConfig` so OAuth-backed MCP servers can refresh tokens and inject `Authorization` headers
- Fixed `/mcp list`, `/mcp test`, `/mcp resources`, `/mcp prompts`, `/mcp enable`, and `/mcp disable` (ACP) to preserve project-over-user precedence when the same server name is defined in both scopes, matching the runtime capability merge so toggling the duplicated name flips the effective entry
- Fixed `/ssh add --port` parsing to reject non-integer values (e.g. `22oops`) instead of silently coercing them via `Number.parseInt`
- Fixed `/ssh list` to deduplicate hosts shared between project and user scopes, listing project entries first to match capability-loader precedence
- Fixed `/export` (ACP) to reject clipboard aliases (`--copy`, `clipboard`, `copy`) instead of using them as the output filename
- Fixed ACP builtin commands (`/compact`, `/force`, `/move`, `/browser`) to surface underlying failures via `output()` instead of swallowing them
- Fixed `/session save|delete` (ACP) to route through the active `SessionManager` so the persist writer is consulted and stale storage references are removed
- Fixed `/reload-plugins`, `/marketplace install|uninstall|upgrade`, and `/plugins enable|disable` (ACP) to refresh slash command registries and emit `available_commands_update` after plugin state changes
- Fixed ACP `usage()` text emission to be awaited so help and error output is not dropped or reordered when commands return immediately
- Fixed ACP `bash` tool to release the client terminal handle on `terminal/output` or `waitForExit` failures, and to race output polling against abort so a stuck RPC cannot delay cancellation
- Fixed ACP `resource` content blocks with `image/*` MIME types to be routed into the LLM `images` array instead of being dropped as opaque blobs
- Fixed `pr://` and `issue://` URLs accepting empty, `.`, or `..` path segments. `pr://owner//77`, `pr://owner/repo/77/diff//2`, and `pr://owner/../77/diff` previously slipped past the `.filter(Boolean)` split and were forwarded to `gh`; now they throw `Invalid <scheme>:// URL: empty or unsafe path segment` before any subprocess work.
- Fixed `read` of `issue://` / `pr://` URLs ignoring the read tool's `AbortSignal`. Aborting a long `pr://<N>/diff/all` or stale issue fetch now propagates into the resolver and short-circuits at the handler entry; previously the `gh` round-trip and cache write ran to completion.
- Fixed `read <path>:raw` (and the `raw: true` arg) still rendering markdown internal-URL content through the formatted markdown renderer. The TUI now respects the raw selector and falls back to the code-cell renderer so verbatim bytes are shown when requested.
- Fixed `eval` tool JS cells crashing with a `structuredClone` error when an awaited final expression returned a non-cloneable value (module namespace, function, symbol, etc.). `displayValue` now falls back to a text representation and logs at debug instead of throwing.
- Fixed `eval` tool JS rewriter missing the final expression when followed by trailing empty statements (e.g. `await Promise.resolve(1);;`). `returnFinalExpression` now scans backward past `EmptyStatement` nodes before deciding there is no final expression.
- Fixed `github` view cache evicting valid rows on open whenever a longer-than-default `github.cache.hardTtlSec` was configured. `openDb()` no longer sweeps with the 7-day default before settings load; the per-lookup `sweepIfDue()` enforces the configured retention exclusively.
- Fixed extension `ctx.shutdown()` being a no-op in the primary interactive path. The handler in `initHooksAndCustomTools` now sets `shutdownRequested` (mirroring the backgrounded-reinit path), and the main REPL loop drains the flag at the post-stream idle boundary so queued steering messages still flush before teardown.
- Fixed plan-mode "Approve and compact context" dispatching queued user input against the stale plan-mode reference path. `setPlanReferencePath(finalPlanFilePath)` now runs before `handleCompactCommand` flushes the compaction queue, so any message typed during compaction is delivered with the approved plan context attached.
- Fixed `.omp/commands/fix-issues.md` and `.omp/commands/review-prs.md` still instructing agents to call the removed `github issue_view` / `pr_view` / `pr_diff` ops; they now reference `read issue://<N>` and `read pr://<N>[/diff[/all|<i>]]`.
- Fixed `ExtensionRunner.initialize()` flushing buffered `credential_disabled` events before mode controllers had a chance to register their `onError` listener. Mode controllers call `runner.initialize(...)` immediately followed by `runner.onError(...)` synchronously; the flush now runs in a microtask after splicing the buffer, so a synchronously throwing `credential_disabled` handler is routed through the registered error listener instead of being silently dropped.

### Security

- Secured the GitHub cache store with strict file permissions (`0600` files) and private permissions for newly created cache directories (`0700`) to reduce local cache exposure

## [14.9.9] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Added new `task.isolation.mode` values `auto`, `apfs`, `btrfs`, `zfs`, `reflink`, `overlayfs`, `projfs`, `block-clone`, and `rcopy` for native PAL-backed task isolation backends
- Added automatic PAL-backed isolation backend selection so `task.isolation.mode` uses the host's best-available backend
- Added input-token and output-token totals to `omp stats --summary`.

### Changed

- Changed `task.isolation.enabled=true` migration to map to `task.isolation.mode = "auto"` instead of legacy `worktree` isolation
- Updated isolation configuration UI labels and descriptions to expose new back-end names (`overlayfs`, `projfs`, etc.) and removed references to deprecated values in guidance text

### Fixed

- Fixed worktree delta capture to include previously untracked file state by baselining untracked patches for both snapshots
- Fixed task isolation startup to try alternate PAL backends when the preferred one is unavailable, allowing successful fallback instead of immediate failure
- Mapped legacy `task.isolation.mode` values `worktree`, `fuse-overlay`, and `fuse-projfs` to their new equivalents during settings migration to preserve behavior with older configs

## [14.9.8] - 2026-05-12

### Breaking Changes

- Changed the `eval` tool input format to a single-line `*** Cell <lang>:"<title>" [t:<duration>] [rst]` header per cell, replacing the `*** Begin <LANG>` / `*** End <LANG>` envelope and the standalone `*** Title:` / `*** Timeout:` / `*** Reset` directives. The lark grammar enforces a fixed attribute order; the runtime parser remains lenient (alias keys, bare positional tokens, single-quoted titles).

### Added

- Added `:conflicts` read selector (`read <path>:conflicts`) to return a one-line index of all unresolved merge conflicts with stable `#N` IDs for quick inspection
- Added bulk conflict resolution with `write({ path: "conflict://*", content })` to resolve all currently registered conflicts across files in one call, expanding `@ours`/`@theirs`/`@base`/`@both` per conflict and returning per-file counts
- Added `read` support for `conflict://<N>` and `read conflict://<N>/<scope>` to inspect unresolved conflict regions captured by a prior read, including `ours`, `theirs`, and `base` side views with original file line alignment
- Added shorthand content tokens `@ours`, `@theirs`, `@both`, and `@base` to conflict-resolution writes using `path: "conflict://<N>"` so replacement content can be composed from recorded conflict sections
- Added conflict count metadata to read results so conflict files now show a warning badge (`⚠ N`) in the read tool UI
- Added support for explicit boolean `rst` values (`rst:true`, `rst:false`, `rst:1`, `rst:0`, `rst:yes`, `rst:no`, `rst:on`, `rst:off`) in `*** Cell` headers
- Added detection of unresolved git merge conflicts in `read` output: each marker block is registered with a session-stable id and surfaced in a footer with `ours`/`theirs` previews. Resolve a block by calling `write({ path: "conflict://<id>", content })` — the tool splices the recorded marker region (markers and all sides) with the supplied content and routes through the normal writethrough (LSP format/diagnostics, fs-cache invalidation).

### Changed

- Changed `read` conflict warning footers to show `X of Y` unresolved conflicts when a range only captures part of a file and provide a `read <path>:conflicts` hint for the full list
- Changed conflict scanning in conflict read paths to inspect the whole file (with a 10 MB cap) so totals better reflect hidden conflicts and truncated scans are called out
- Changed conflict marker scanning during `read` to only register fully formed, column-0 merge-marker blocks, so indented or malformed marker-like lines are no longer treated as conflicts
- Changed `write` conflict resolution to validate `conflict://` IDs and report clear errors for malformed or unknown conflict URIs
- Changed the HTML transcript renderer to parse the new `*** Cell` headers while keeping the older `*** Begin <LANG>` and `===== ... =====` formats renderable for historical sessions.
- Changed the `eval` tool parser so a stray non-marker line between cells no longer crashes with `null is not an object (evaluating 'BEGIN_RE.exec(lines[i])[1]')`; stray content is consumed without aborting parsing.
- Changed `*** End` to be an optional, undocumented per-cell terminator (kept in the lark to satisfy GPT-trained models' natural terminator habit during constrained sampling).

### Fixed

- Fixed single-conflict `write` retries to re-locate the recorded conflict block by exact marker content so shifted line numbers from out-of-band edits no longer prevent resolution
- Fixed `read conflict://*` handling by rejecting wildcard reads with a clear write-only guidance error
- Fixed conflict resolution to verify the live file still contains recorded `<<<<<<<` and `>>>>>>>` markers before splicing, preventing stale conflict IDs from silently corrupting out-of-band-edited files
- Fixed `@base` token handling so two-way conflicts without a base section now return a clear error
- Improved `*** Cell` header parsing to reject invalid `rst` values with a clear `invalid rst value` error

## [14.9.7] - 2026-05-12

### Breaking Changes

- Changed the `timeoutMs` execution option to no longer be enforced during worker-based JS runs, so callers must rely on external cancellation signals for time limits
- Replaced the Jupyter kernel gateway + WebSocket protocol behind the Python `eval` backend with a subprocess-backed runner that speaks NDJSON over stdin/stdout; removed the `jupyter_kernel_gateway`/`ipykernel` pip dependencies, the `python.sharedGateway` setting, the `omp jupyter` CLI command, and the `PI_PYTHON_GATEWAY_URL` / `PI_PYTHON_GATEWAY_TOKEN` environment variables

### Added

- Added Python `tool.<name>(args)` support to `executePython` sessions so evaluated Python code can invoke session tools through the prelude `tool` proxy
- Added per-execution Python tool bridge session registration and loopback endpoint wiring so Python tool calls resolve to host tools and return tool results
- Added status-event forwarding for Python tool bridge calls so `tool` invocations can emit execution status updates
- Added browser-tab JavaScript execution through the shared runtime so tab runs now expose the standard helper globals (`read`, `write`, `sort`, `uniq`, `counter`, `diff`, `tree`, `env`, `output`, `display`, and `tool`)
- Added static ESM `import` support to browser-tab JavaScript by rewriting top-level imports and resolving them against the tab session context
- Added substring fallback matching to `HistoryStorage.search` so infix and short-token queries that FTS5 prefix matching misses are still returned
- Added a live single-line sync progress display to the stats command showing current/total sessions while syncing
- Added automatic inline JS evaluation fallback when worker creation failed so script execution still works in environments without worker support

### Changed

- Changed `setup python` to only verify a reachable Python 3 interpreter instead of installing Jupyter dependencies
- Changed `info` output to remove the obsolete Python Gateway status block now that shared gateway management is no longer available
- Changed JavaScript execution in `executeJs` to expose the worker\u2019s real `process` object instead of a restricted, frozen subset
- Changed JavaScript evaluation to run per session in a worker-backed runner with explicit initialization and teardown handling
- Changed the Python backend to launch one `python -u runner.py` subprocess per kernel; cancellation now sends `SIGINT` which raises a real `KeyboardInterrupt` in user code, and the same subprocess is reused across cells in session mode
- Changed Python magic handling so `%pip`, `%cd`, `%env`, `%pwd`, `%ls`, `%time`, `%timeit`, `%who`, `%reset`, `%load`, `%run`, `%%bash`, `%%capture`, `%%timeit`, `%%writefile`, and `!shell` work without depending on IPython

### Fixed

- Fixed Python output rendering so `text/markdown` takes precedence over `text/plain` and status bundles are emitted as status updates rather than plain text
- Fixed query tokenization in `HistoryStorage.search` so punctuation-delimited terms like `git-commit` are aligned with indexing and matched correctly
- Fixed history search result merging to de-duplicate matches and return full-text matches before substring-only matches while still respecting the requested limit
- Fixed JS run cancellation so aborting a run now also cancels in-flight tool calls and terminates the active worker session
- Fixed top-level `const`, `let`, and `class` declarations in evaluated JavaScript to persist across subsequent runs by rewriting top-level declarations

## [14.9.5] - 2026-05-12
### Breaking Changes

- Removed the `jobs://` internal URL protocol; inspect background jobs via the `job` tool's `list: true` operation instead

### Added

- Added `since` and `until` date-range filters to `search_issues`, `search_prs`, `search_commits`, and `search_repos`, accepting relative durations (`m`/`h`/`d`/`w`/`mo`/`y`), ISO dates, and ISO datetimes
- Added `dateField` support for date filtering (`created` or `updated`) so search results can be constrained by creation, update, pushed (for repos), or committer date (for commits)
- Added owner-based scoping to async job registration and queries so background jobs can be registered with an `ownerId` and filtered per agent in `getRunningJobs`, `getRecentJobs`, `getAllJobs`, and `cancelAll`
- Added agent ownership metadata to async jobs started by `task` and `bash` tools so their lifecycle and cancellation is attributed to the creating agent
- Added `list: true` operation to the `job` tool, returning an immediate snapshot of every job spawned by the calling agent without waiting (replaces the deleted `jobs://` URL)
- Added per-agent visibility scoping to the `job` tool so `list`, `poll`, and `cancel` only see and act on jobs owned by the calling agent; cross-agent operations now return `not_found`

### Changed

- Changed `search_issues`, `search_prs`, `search_commits`, and `search_repos` to allow date-only queries where `query` is omitted if `since`/`until` is provided
- Changed `search_code` to return a validation error when `since`/`until` is supplied because GitHub code search does not support date qualifiers
- Changed async job manager ownership so subagents inherit the parent session’s global `AsyncJobManager` instead of creating and owning separate instances
- Changed session lifecycle cleanup so the global async-job manager is disposed only by the owning top-level session
- Changed subagent session switches and handoff paths to stop global async-job cancellation and cancel only jobs owned by that session
- Changed `agent://` and `artifact://` URL resolution to search artifact outputs across all active sessions instead of only the current session, allowing parent and subagent sessions to read each other’s generated outputs by ID
- Changed `memory://` URL resolution to walk all active sessions’ memory roots and return the first matching file, so worktree-based subagents can access their own memory views as well as shared roots
- Changed internal URL routing to use a shared process-global `InternalUrlRouter` and protocol handlers, so built-in tools resolve `agent://`, `artifact://`, `memory://`, `skill://`, `rule://`, `mcp://`, and `local://` URLs without requiring session-specific router wiring
- Changed `mcp://` handler to use the globally registered MCP manager so MCP resource links work for agents sharing session context

### Changed

- Changed the `ask.timeout` default from `30` (seconds) to `0` (wait indefinitely). Auto-selecting the recommended option after a fixed delay was surprising users mid-deliberation; the timer is now strictly opt-in. The legacy auto-select behavior is preserved when `ask.timeout` is set to a non-zero value, and the `ask` tool's prompt has been updated so the model expects unlimited reply time by default.

### Fixed

- Added `ModelRegistry.hasConfiguredAuth(model)` to mirror the upstream `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` API surface; external plugins and downstream wrappers that pre-flight auth before launching a subagent no longer crash with `this._modelRegistry.hasConfiguredAuth is not a function` on the direct agent-launch path. ([#993](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/993))
- Fixed an ESM circular-import TDZ that crashed test suites when modules from the `task/` and `tools/` graphs were evaluated together (e.g. `executor-warnings.test.ts` + `task-simple-mode.test.ts`) by deferring `BUILTIN_TOOLS.task`'s `TaskTool.create` dereference to factory-call time and sourcing `truncateTail` from `session/streaming-output` instead of the `tools/` barrel
- Treat keyless-by-design providers (llama.cpp, ollama, lm-studio) as authenticated in subagent model resolution; fixes silent fallback to parent remote model when a local model is configured. ([#1008](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1008))
- Fixed subagent disposal and session transitions that previously canceled all running async jobs, preventing inadvertent termination of a parent agent’s background work
- Fixed multi-entry edits silently rendering a fake success when every entry failed (e.g. all hit the auto-generated guard), by surfacing `isError: true` from the single-path edit orchestrator so the renderer takes the error branch instead of falling through to the streaming-preview fallback that displays the *proposed* diff
- Fixed the auto-generated streaming guard being gated behind `edit.streamingAbort` (default false), so it now pre-empts streaming edit tool calls targeting auto-generated files regardless of that setting
- Fixed subagents launched in the same parallel batch not seeing each other in their initial `# IRC Peers` system-prompt block by pre-registering the agent in the global `AgentRegistry` before `rebuildSystemPrompt` runs and attaching the live session afterwards
- Fixed plugin manifest extensions whose entry points at a directory (e.g. `pi-goal`'s `"pi": { "extensions": [".pi/extensions/pi-goal"] }`) failing to load with `Failed to load extension: Directories cannot be read like files`. The plugin path resolver now resolves directory entries to their `index.{ts,js,mjs,cjs}` file, matching the behavior of native auto-discovery via `resolveExtensionEntries`.
- Fixed the SSH tool on native Windows by avoiding OpenSSH ControlMaster multiplexing, which Win32-OpenSSH does not support and reports as `getsockname failed` ([#154](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/154)).
- Fixed `/export` and `/tree` not showing developer-role messages (including the plan content injected after `/plan` approval) so the HTML export and TUI session tree now render developer messages dimmed with their actual content instead of hiding them entirely ([#753](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/753))
- Fixed `Timed out initializing browser tab worker` on prebuilt binaries by rewriting `spawnTabWorker` to import the worker entry with `with { type: "file" }` so Bun's `--compile` bundler statically discovers and embeds `tab-worker-entry.ts` in the single-file binary ([#1011](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1011))

## [14.9.3] - 2026-05-10
### Breaking Changes

- Changed the `eval` tool input format to canonical `*** Begin <LANG>` ... `*** End <LANG>` cells with `*** Title`, `*** Timeout`, and `*** Reset` directives, so legacy `===== ... =====` eval inputs are no longer accepted for execution
- Removed the `sectionSeparator` re-export from `config/prompt-templates`, so existing imports from `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent/config/prompt-templates` now need to resolve `sectionSeparator` from its utility package

### Added

- Added support for the `*** Abort` recovery marker in eval and hashline parsing to terminate processing safely when stream corruption is detected
- Added support for wrapping hashline edits in `*** Begin Patch` and `*** End Patch` markers so patch input with these envelopes is parsed and applied
- Added support in the HTML export renderer for the new `*** Begin`/`*** End` eval cell format
- Added a dedicated `[now]` prompt block to `buildSystemPrompt` output containing current date, current working directory, and required end-of-turn continuation/verification guidance
- Added a new `[project]` prompt block wrapper around workstation and workspace context and ensured it is emitted as a separate system prompt segment
- Added dedicated HTML rendering for `eval` tool calls, including cell-by-cell parsing of `===== ... =====` blocks with inferred Python/JS/TypeScript highlighting
- Added dedicated rendering support for `search`, `recipe`, and `irc` tool calls in transcript exports
- Added a collapsible `Available Tools` section with a tool count and chip-style compact tool names
- Added macOS power assertion settings `power.preventIdleSleep`, `power.preventSystemSleep`, `power.declareUserActive`, and `power.preventDisplaySleep` so users can control what types of sleep are blocked during sessions

### Changed

- Kept legacy `===== ... =====` eval transcripts renderable in HTML while adding parsing for the new `*** Begin` format for newer transcripts
- Changed the system prompt’s Bash usage guidance to explicitly forbid specific anti-patterns (`sed`/`awk` line-range reads, stderr redirects, and `| head|tail` pagination) and require using dedicated tools for those operations
- Changed delegated subagent prompts so shared task context is now rendered only in the system-level `[context]` block, while the user-facing task message now contains only the assignment prompt text
- Changed system prompt rendering to use block markers such as `[env]`, `[contract]`, `[role]`, `[coop]`, and `[closure]` for more explicit structural instructions
- Changed the working-directory value in rendered prompts to use `shortenPath` before interpolation
- Updated subagent prompt assembly to compose prompt blocks and place the `[now]` block after the subagent-specific instructions
- Changed GitHub (`gh`) tool cards to include operation, PR, branch, and truncated query/title/body details
- Changed tool-call output to display internal `_i` intent separately and hide it from rendered argument JSON
- Changed `ast_edit` and `find`/`search` rendering to show resolved path values and option flags such as `limit`, `no-hidden`, and `no-reply`
- Changed power assertion behavior to take effect only while a prompt is in flight, replacing session-level persistent assertions

### Removed

- Removed the unused `head` and `tail` parameters from the `bash` tool schema, along with the dead `normalizeBashCommand` / `applyHeadTail` post-processing module — output truncation is already handled by the harness's streaming tail buffer and artifact spillover, so the agent should rely on `read` (or the artifact link) instead of inline truncation pipes.

### Fixed

- Fixed eval tool outputs to append a truncation warning and ask users to re-issue remaining work when parsing is aborted by `*** Abort`
- Fixed hashline parsing and input splitting to stop at `*** Abort` and ignore trailing edits after the marker
- Fixed subagent task prompt construction so a trailing `[now]` block in the base prompts is preserved and not swallowed when rendering `subagent-system-prompt`
- Fixed edit rendering so provided `input` text is shown in the export even without a file path
- Fixed `args.paths` handling in `ast_edit` and `find` so multiple paths are shown as a comma-separated list
- Fixed power assertion state handling so subsequent prompts are no longer blocked after an aborted or canceled prompt
- Fixed IRC background exchange poll loop leaking after session disposal: `#scheduleBackgroundExchangeFlush` now stops immediately when `dispose()` is called, preventing stale `setTimeout` callbacks from firing against a torn-down agent

## [14.9.2] - 2026-05-10
### Added

- Added `agentsMdFiles` to `WorkspaceTree` so AGENTS.md discovery results are returned with the workspace scan output

### Changed

- Changed startup workspace discovery to use one native `listWorkspace` walk for both the rendered tree and AGENTS.md directory-context candidates, removing the layered `git ls-files` orchestration and secondary AGENTS.md glob.

### Fixed

- Fixed AGENTS.md context discovery to include AGENTS.md files that are explicitly gitignored while still excluding AGENTS.md files under ignored directories
- Fixed task tool renderer spamming `Tool renderer failed: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'args.tasks.length')` warnings while a `task` call was streaming in (the `tasks` array is undefined until the partial JSON parser closes it); the renderer now tolerates an absent `tasks` field and shows `0 agents` until the array arrives ([#985](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/985)).
- Fixed MCP HTTP streamable transport spamming `HTTP SSE stream error: ReadableStream already has a controller` after every JSON-RPC request whose response was returned as `text/event-stream`. The transport used to break out of the SSE iterator once the matching response was captured and then re-open `response.body` for a background drain, but the body had already been piped through a `TransformStream` and could not be re-read. The drain now runs from a single iterator that resolves the response promise inline and continues to dispatch piggybacked notifications on the same stream.

## [14.9.0] - 2026-05-10
### Breaking Changes

- Moved hashline APIs to the dedicated `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent/hashline` module, moved hash helpers to `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent/hashline/hash`, and removed the legacy `edit/modes/hashline` and `edit/line-hash` source subpaths.

### Removed

- Removed hashline auto-rebase. Anchor mismatches now reject immediately so the model re-reads instead of silently relocating an edit to a hash-collision within ±5 lines, which could otherwise apply the change to the wrong region. Stale-anchor recovery via the cached read snapshot is unaffected.

### Fixed

- Fixed compaction crashing with `auth_unavailable` when the current model's provider has no credentials configured; compaction now falls back to an available model role (or fails fast with a clear error) instead of attempting a doomed provider call ([#986](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/986)).
- Fixed top-level static import rewriting in JS evaluation to use parser-based detection so only real import declarations are rewritten and `import` text inside strings, comments, or template literals is preserved
- Fixed `import ... with` attribute handling in rewritten ESM imports so static imports with module attributes now become dynamic imports with matching `with` options
- Fixed model resolution silently falling back to a different provider (e.g. Amazon Bedrock) when `modelRoles` specified a fully-qualified `<provider>/<id>` whose exact pair was not in the bundled catalog. Explicit provider prefixes are now honored or surface a clear error ([#980](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/980)).
- Fixed session count inflation on Anthropic backend caused by a fresh random `metadata.user_id` being generated on every API request; all requests within one conversation now share a stable `metadata.user_id` derived from the session ID, matching the expected one-session-per-conversation counting
- Fixed plan mode review resubmits to append each refreshed `local://PLAN.md` preview to the chat history, preserving the full refined plan in terminal scrollback.
- Fixed compaction requests (manual and auto) not carrying `metadata.user_id`, leaving them unattributed on the backend
- Fixed direct session-bound LLM calls (`/btw` ephemeral turns via `runEphemeralTurn`, branch summarization, session title generation) bypassing the agent and emitting a fresh random `metadata.user_id` per request on Anthropic OAuth: the session-level `prepareSimpleStreamOptions` helper now stamps the agent's session metadata onto direct calls, and `generateBranchSummary` plus `generateSessionTitle` accept and forward an explicit `metadata` option from the call site
- Fixed `metadata.user_id` lacking the authenticated `account_uuid` on Anthropic OAuth requests; sessions now install a dynamic resolver via `Agent#setMetadataResolver` that builds `{ session_id, account_uuid? }` per request, looking the live OAuth account UUID up from `AuthStorage` so it stays in sync with token refreshes and login/logout transitions instead of stranding a stale value
- Fixed multi-file legacy Pi extensions failing to load when sibling `.ts` files import each other via relative paths ([#983](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/983)).
- Fixed sub-agent dispatch silently routing to a model whose provider has no working credentials (e.g. an unqualified `modelRoles.task` id like `qwen3.6-plus-free` resolving to a provider the user is not authenticated against). Task dispatch now falls back to the parent session's active model — which by definition has working auth — when the resolved subagent model has none ([#985](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/985)).

### Added

- Added a debug-panel raw SSE stream viewer so stuck model/tool-call streams can be inspected live from the TUI.

### Fixed

- Fixed legacy Pi plugin extensions failing to load on Windows when their entry path contains a drive letter ([#990](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/990) by [@jiwangyihao](https://github.com/jiwangyihao)).

### Added

- Added `get_login_providers` RPC command to list registered OAuth providers with their current authentication status (`id`, `name`, `available`, `authenticated`)
- Added `login` RPC command to trigger OAuth login for a given provider; emits an `open_url` extension UI event (fire-and-forget) carrying the auth URL and optional instructions so headless clients can open the browser, then resolves when the callback-server flow completes
- Added `open_url` variant to `RpcExtensionUIRequest` for the above
- Added `getLoginProviders()` and `login(providerId)` methods to `RpcClient`

## [14.8.0] - 2026-05-09
### Added

- Added hashline stale-anchor recovery by replaying edits against a session-scoped `read`/`search` snapshot and 3-way-merging them onto the current file when anchors no longer match

### Fixed

- Fixed legacy pi extensions failing to import their own bare-specifier dependencies (e.g. `import x from "pkg"`): files loaded via the `omp-legacy-pi-file:` namespace now pre-resolve bare imports against the extension's directory so the extension's own `node_modules` is honored.

### Changed

- Changed hashline success output to include a warning when stale-anchor recovery is used

## [14.7.8] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed

- Fixed indefinite startup hang on large repos introduced in 14.7.6 ([#975](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/975)) on two fronts: (1) `createAgentSession` was awaiting `buildAgentsMdSearch` and `buildWorkspaceTree` directly in its blocking `Promise.all`, bypassing the existing 5s preparation deadline that previously protected startup — both scans are now raced against a 5s deadline and fall back to the system-prompt fallback path on timeout; (2) `buildWorkspaceTree` now derives its listing from `git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard` when the workspace is a git worktree, which is O(index size) and avoids the per-call full-tree gitignore-aware native scan that the previous implementation triggered. Repos without git, or where the call fails / times out, transparently fall back to the previous native-glob path.

## [14.7.6] - 2026-05-07
### Changed

- Changed the "Hide Thinking Blocks" setting (Ctrl+T) to also instruct the provider to omit thinking/reasoning summaries from responses, instead of just hiding them client-side. Anthropic sees `thinking.display = "omitted"` (where supported); OpenAI Responses / Azure / Codex requests drop `reasoning.summary` entirely.

### Fixed

- Fixed the `Hide Thinking Blocks` toggle so changing it updates the active session’s request settings immediately, ensuring new responses reflect the current hide-thinking preference
- Fixed system prompt preparation to keep successful context data and only fall back to minimal defaults for preparation steps that fail
- Fixed system prompt preparation timeout to apply per-step instead of all-or-nothing: a single slow step (e.g. `buildAgentsMdSearch` on a huge directory tree, `buildWorkspaceTree`, `loadProjectContextFiles`) now falls back to its own minimal default while the other steps still populate, and the warning names which steps timed out.
- Fixed subagents re-running expensive workspace scans (`buildAgentsMdSearch`, `buildWorkspaceTree`) on every spawn: parents now forward their already-resolved `AGENTS.md` search and workspace tree to subagents through `createAgentSession`, matching how `contextFiles`, `skills`, and `promptTemplates` are already inherited. On large monorepos this removes seconds of redundant work per `task` invocation and prevents the per-subagent system-prompt timeout warnings.

## [14.7.5] - 2026-05-07
### Added

- Added optional `/loop` limits: `/loop 10` stops after 10 auto-iterations, while duration forms such as `/loop 10m` and `/loop 10min` stop after the time limit.

### Changed

- Changed `/loop` to include the configured limit and remaining budget in the enabled status message

### Fixed

- Fixed `/loop` handling of malformed count or duration arguments by showing usage errors instead of enabling unbounded loop mode
- Fixed inherited disabled macOS malloc stack logging variables leaking into shell sessions and spamming Bun subprocess output with `MallocStackLogging` warnings.

## [14.7.4] - 2026-05-07

### Breaking Changes

- Removed the dedicated `notebook` tool; `.ipynb` reads and edits now go through `read` and `edit`.

### Changed

- Changed diff previews to syntax-highlight contiguous context lines in the unchanged sections when file language can be detected
- Changed `read` tool behavior for `.ipynb:raw` requests to return raw notebook content instead of converting via markit
- Changed `.ipynb` edit and read handling to route through notebook serialization helpers
- Changed `.ipynb` reads to return an editable cell text representation and apply edits back to notebook JSON while preserving cell metadata and outputs where possible.

### Removed

- Removed the `notebook.enabled` configuration option from tool settings

### Fixed

- Fixed hashline edit streaming preview collapsing to a header-only "opaque box" when a second `@PATH` section header arrived mid-stream — earlier completed sections now stay rendered while the trailing section is still being typed.

## [14.7.2] - 2026-05-06
### Breaking Changes

- Removed the exported `BUILTIN_TOOL_METADATA` API, including `BuiltinEntry`-style metadata exports and discoverable-built-in helper exports, which will break consumers relying on those symbols

### Changed

- Updated discoverable tool search (`search_tool_bm25` and related discovery metadata) to read each tool’s own `summary` field when present, improving discoverability descriptions for built-in tools

### Fixed

- Fixed SearXNG web search Basic Auth validation to reject RFC 7617 control characters and clarified the equivalent `config.yml` and environment variable settings.
- Fixed extension commands that return without starting a model turn leaving the interactive `Working…` spinner active indefinitely. (#927)
- Fixed `authHeader: true` provider overrides without custom `models` so built-in model transport headers receive `Authorization: Bearer <resolved-key>` (#929).

## [14.7.1] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- Added `pr_create` operation to the GitHub tool to create pull requests with title/body (or `fill`), base/head branch, draft, reviewer, assignee, and label options and return a summarized result including the new PR URL
- Added `read.summarize.prose` setting to keep Markdown and plain-text reads out of the structural summarizer by default.

### Changed

- Changed the `PI_GREP_WORKERS` environment variable help text to state that it sets filesystem walker workers, defaults to 4, and uses `0` for automatic worker selection
- Changed hashline replacement and pure-insert auto-absorb to also drop a single duplicated structural-closing line (`}`, `);`, `]`, etc.) on either boundary when keeping it would unbalance brackets. The pure-insert variant fires regardless of `edit.hashlineAutoDropPureInsertDuplicates`, while the existing 2+ line generic absorb stays gated on that setting.

## [14.7.0] - 2026-05-04
### Breaking Changes

- Changed session system-prompt APIs to use ordered string block arrays by requiring `buildSystemPrompt`, `CreateAgentSessionOptions.systemPrompt`, `Session.rebuildSystemPrompt`, and extension `before_agent_start`/`getSystemPrompt` hooks to accept and return `systemPrompt: string[]` instead of a plain system-prompt string or separate `projectPrompt` field
- Changed `buildSystemPrompt` and session `rebuildSystemPrompt` APIs to return `{ systemPrompt, projectPrompt }`, requiring callers expecting a plain system prompt string to update to the new shape
- Removed the top-level `sel` parameter from the `read` tool schema, requiring callers to migrate to `path`-embedded selectors (for example `path:50-100`, `path:raw`, or `https://...:L1-L40`)

### Added

- Added a separate `projectPrompt` artifact containing per-session project context (workstation, context files, AGENTS.md rules, workspace tree, and append prompt) so dynamic context is decoupled from the static system prompt
- Added `Project prompt` token accounting to context-usage breakdowns and charts
- Added `tools.elideFileMutationInputs` setting to optionally elide large `write`, `edit`, and `apply_patch` payloads in history after successful mutations
- Added hashline-style return data for elided `write` calls so tools can include the resulting file content without leaking full input text
- Added `buildDirectoryTree` and `DirectoryTree` exports to generate configurable directory trees with options for depth, entry limits, hidden-file handling, and truncation caps
- Added `buildWorkspaceTree` and `WorkspaceTree` exports so callers can precompute and pass a workspace context to prompt generation
- Added `workspaceTree` support to `buildSystemPrompt` options to reuse a prebuilt directory snapshot
- Added `read.summarize.enabled`, `read.summarize.minBodyLines`, and `read.summarize.minCommentLines` settings to control whether `read` returns structural summaries and how many multiline body/comment lines are collapsed
- Added `edit.hashlineAutoDropPureInsertDuplicates` setting to opt into dropping 2+ pure-insert hashline payload lines that duplicate adjacent file context; default is `false`.

### Changed

- Updated session dump and HTML export output to serialize ordered system-prompt blocks (including project context) and removed the dedicated project-prompt dump section
- Renamed context-usage system-prompt accounting from a separate `projectPrompt` bucket to `systemContext` to match the new multi-block prompt structure
- Changed prompt delivery to inject non-empty `projectPrompt` as a leading `developer` message before conversation messages instead of merging it into the base system prompt
- Added `projectPrompt` to session dumps to expose the injected per-session project context separately
- Changed write success output and preview rendering to display hashline-formatted written content from captured file text when mutation inputs are elided
- Changed `read` directory rendering to return a two-level recency-sorted directory tree (including nested folders) instead of a flat alphabetical entry list, while still applying configurable truncation
- Changed generated system prompts to include a working-directory tree block after directory context, showing recent files/directories (depth ≤ 3) and truncation notices when entries are elided
- Changed `read` summary rendering to merge opening- and closing-brace boundaries around elided sections into a single `..` line (including closers like `};` or `})`), reducing those segments to one concise anchored summary line
- Changed default `read` output for parseable code files without an explicit selector to return a structural summary instead of full verbatim lines, while still supporting full output for `:raw` and explicit ranges
- Changed truncation/pagination hints in read, archive, and SQLite outputs to use colon syntax (`Use :<offset>`) when continuing reads
- Changed the read tool UI preview title to include summary elision counts when a summary is returned
- Changed hashline pure-insert duplicate auto-drop to be opt-in through `edit.hashlineAutoDropPureInsertDuplicates` instead of always enabled.

### Fixed

- Fixed selector parsing for colon-containing paths by only splitting `:<sel>` when the suffix matches a valid line-range or `raw` pattern, preventing paths like `db.sqlite:users:42` from being misread as selectors

## [14.6.6] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- Added Ctrl+D draft persistence: pressing Ctrl+D with text in the editor now exits the app and saves the unsent text as a per-session draft. Resuming the same session (e.g. via `--resume`) restores the draft into the editor (one-shot, removed after restore).

## [14.6.4] - 2026-05-03
### Added

- Added `hindsight.mentalModelsEnabled`, `hindsight.mentalModelAutoSeed`, `hindsight.mentalModelRefreshIntervalMs`, and `hindsight.mentalModelMaxRenderChars` settings to control curated Hindsight mental-model activation, seeding, refresh cadence, and prompt render budget
- Added `<mental_models>` injection to developer instructions, loading bank-level curated summaries as stable background context
- Added built-in `/memory mm` commands (`list`, `show`, `refresh`, `history`, `seed`, `reload`, `delete`) to inspect and manage mental models on the active bank
- Added scope-aware mental-model seeding for `global`, `per-project`, and `per-project-tagged` banks, including built-in seed models like user preferences, project conventions, and project decisions
- Added warning output when hashline block replacements auto-absorbed duplicate boundary lines

### Changed

- Changed `/memory clear` and `/memory enqueue` to apply only to the current agent session’s Hindsight cache instead of all live Hindsight sessions
- Changed the prompt assembly order so `<mental_models>` blocks are appended before `<memories>` recall blocks in developer instructions

### Fixed

- Fixed Hindsight memory prompt injection and recall/retain tool execution to resolve against the active session state, preventing context from an unrelated session from being used
- Fixed subagent `/task` sessions to persist memories into the parent agent’s Hindsight bank by explicit parent state wiring
- Fixed per-session memory retention behavior when switching or resuming sessions by rekeying Hindsight state and resetting conversation-tracking counters so first-turn recall and nth-turn retain cadence no longer leak across conversations
- Fixed the first-turn startup race so `<mental_models>` appears in the opening system prompt when mental-model loading is enabled
- Fixed retention hygiene by stripping `<mental_models>` blocks from retained content to prevent curated summaries from feeding back into future memory writes
- Fixed `<mental_models>` rendering to honor the configured character budget and truncate with an explicit truncation marker when the snapshot exceeds limits
- Fixed hashline replacements so duplicated payload boundary lines adjacent to a replaced block are absorbed into the replacement range instead of being duplicated

## [14.6.3] - 2026-05-03

### Breaking Changes

- Renamed hashline separator configuration from `PI_HASHLINE_SEP` to `PI_HL_SEP` and changed the default payload separator from `\\` to `>`

### Added

- Added inline hashline edit syntax so `< ANCHOR${sep}TEXT` prepended text to an anchored line and `+ ANCHOR${sep}TEXT` appended text to it without requiring a multi-line payload block
- Added a `memory.backend` setting (off, local, hindsight) under a new Memory settings tab to control which memory subsystem is active
- Added Hindsight memory settings (`hindsight.*`) for API connection, bank identification, and recall/retain policy
- Added `retain`, `recall`, and `reflect` tools for direct long-term memory search, retention, and reflection when using the Hindsight backend
- Added `hindsight.scoping` setting (`global`, `per-project`, `per-project-tagged`) that controls whether memories are shared across projects, isolated per cwd, or tagged so global + project memories merge on recall (default: `per-project-tagged`)
- Added `search_code`, `search_commits`, and `search_repos` ops to the `github` tool so the search surface mirrors `gh search`'s subcommands

### Changed

- Changed `hindsight` tool retains to enqueue memory writes and return `Memory queued.` immediately instead of waiting on a network request
- Changed `hindsight` tool memory writes to use automatic background batching (up to 16 items or 5 seconds) so tool calls do not block
- Changed failed `hindsight` queue flushes to be surfaced as UI warning notices rather than failing the foreground `hindsight` tool call
- Changed hashline read/search previews and diff output to keep `|` as the anchor-to-text separator while using the separate configured edit payload separator
- Mapped invalid `hindsight.scoping` settings back to the default `per-project-tagged` behavior with a warning
- Changed `/memory view`, `/memory clear`, and `/memory enqueue` to route through the selected memory backend instead of being hardcoded to local memories
- Changed compaction context assembly to include backend-provided recall context when available
- Updated multi-path `search`, `find`, `ast-edit`, and `ast-grep` calls to skip missing base paths, returning matches from remaining paths and reporting skipped paths in output
- Replaced `hindsight.dynamicBankId` (boolean) with the explicit `hindsight.scoping` enum; legacy values are migrated automatically (`dynamicBankId=true` → `scoping="per-project"`)
- Changed `search_repos` to run as a global repository search using query qualifiers without applying the `repo` filter

### Deprecated

- Set explicit `hindsight.scoping` now takes precedence over legacy `hindsight.dynamicBankId` when migrating old settings

### Removed

- Removed legacy `hindsight.dynamicBankId` and `hindsight.agentName` fields from the active settings model
- Removed `hindsight.agentName` and the `HINDSIGHT_AGENT_NAME` / `HINDSIGHT_CHANNEL_ID` / `HINDSIGHT_USER_ID` env vars; the legacy `agent::project::channel::user` bank tuple is gone. A user-set `agentName` is migrated onto `hindsight.bankId`.

### Fixed

- Fixed pending `hindsight` queued memory writes to flush on agent end, clear, and enqueue operations so tool-invoked facts are not dropped when sessions transition
- Fixed retained memory writes from the `hindsight` tool to include session context and tags consistently in background batches
- Fixed inline hashline modify operations to fail fast when combined with a delete or replace on the same target line
- Fixed hashline parsing of payload blocks to handle a shared extra leading symbol prefix (such as markdown `>>`) on all payload lines by stripping it as an auto-correction instead of rejecting the edit
- Forwarded project scoping tags to `hindsight` retain, recall, and reflect operations so manual memory commands honor the active tagging mode
- Fixed legacy migrations by mapping existing `memories.enabled` values to `memory.backend` on load to preserve prior enable/disable behavior
- Fixed memory retention so recalled `<memories>` blocks and legacy `<hindsight_memories>` / `<relevant_memories>` blocks are stripped before storing transcripts and do not feed back as new memory
- Fixed `search_code` output to include each match path, repository, shortened SHA, and a one-line matching fragment
- Fixed `search_commits` output to show shortened SHAs with commit message first lines
- Fixed `search_repos` output formatting to return repository summaries including language, stars, forks, issues, visibility, and key status fields

## [14.6.2] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- Added `statusLine.sessionAccent` to disable session-name accent coloring for the editor border and status line gap ([#918](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/918))

### Fixed

- Disabled repeated OSC 11 background-color polling under WSL to avoid Windows terminal tab crashes while keeping initial and event-driven appearance detection ([#914](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/914))

- Fixed SSH ControlMaster socket paths to use OpenSSH's connection hash (`%C`) so connections to the same host with different users, ports, or jump hosts do not share a master session.

## [14.6.1] - 2026-05-02

### Changed

- Updated GitHub call headers to display operation-specific titles and contextual metadata such as repository, branch, issue/PR IDs, and search query snippets for supported operations
- Changed non-run-watch result rendering to honor terminal width, truncate long lines, and show a `+N more lines` expansion hint when output exceeds the preview limit

### Fixed

- Fixed GitHub tool output fallbacks that previously always showed a GitHub Run Watch heading so they now show the actual operation and clear `no output`/`request failed` status messaging

## [14.6.0] - 2026-05-02

### Breaking Changes

- Reworked autoresearch storage and protocol. State now lives in `~/.omp/autoresearch/<project>.db` (SQLite) and per-run logs in `~/.omp/autoresearch/<project>/runs/<id>/benchmark.log`. The repo-side artifacts `autoresearch.md`, `autoresearch.sh`, `autoresearch.checks.sh`, `autoresearch.program.md`, `autoresearch.ideas.md`, `autoresearch.jsonl`, `.autoresearch/`, and `autoresearch.config.json` are no longer read or written; they are deleted by `/autoresearch clear`. Any existing data is not migrated.
- Removed the autoresearch edit guard. `write`/`edit`/`ast_edit` are no longer blocked based on scope. Scope/off-limits are now post-hoc accountability fields on `log_experiment`.
- Replaced rigid `init_experiment` contract validation with a simpler schema: `name`, `goal`, `primary_metric`, `metric_unit`, `direction`, `secondary_metrics`, `scope_paths`, `off_limits`, `constraints`, `max_iterations`, `new_segment`. Removed `from_autoresearch_md`, `abandon_unlogged_runs`, `force`, and `preferred_command` flags — the harness `./autoresearch.sh` is the canonical workload, edit it and bump segment when you need to change it.
- `run_experiment` no longer accepts a `command` parameter. The tool always runs `bash autoresearch.sh`. To change the workload, edit the harness and call `init_experiment new_segment: true`. Removed `force`, `checks_timeout_seconds`, and the legacy `autoresearch.checks.sh` auto-execution; run validation through the regular `bash` tool.
- Replaced `log_experiment` ASI requirements and `force`/`skip_restore` flags with `justification` (post-hoc explanation for scope deviations) and `flag_runs` (mark earlier runs suspect to exclude them from baseline math). ASI is now opaque metadata.
- `/autoresearch clear` now resets the worktree to the session's recorded baseline commit (when on an `autoresearch/*` branch or with `--reset-tree`), closes the active session, and deletes any leftover legacy autoresearch repo artifacts.
- `/autoresearch` now refuses on a dirty worktree with an explicit error instead of silently continuing on the current branch. Commit or stash before invoking — the session needs a clean baseline on a dedicated `autoresearch/*` branch.
- Split `/autoresearch` into a two-phase protocol. Phase 1 (no session) prompts the agent to build the benchmark harness as `./autoresearch.sh` (must exit 0 and print `METRIC <name>=<value>`). Calling `init_experiment` ends Phase 1: it requires `./autoresearch.sh` to exist, auto-commits any pending harness changes on an `autoresearch/*` branch, then records that commit as the baseline. Phase 2 is the existing iteration loop.
- Autoresearch sessions are now scoped to the git branch they were created on. Switching off the `autoresearch/*` branch hides the dashboard widget, detaches the experiment tools, and skips the autoresearch system prompt; switching back resumes seamlessly. `/autoresearch` on a fresh branch starts a fresh session instead of resurrecting a session bound to a different branch.
- `log_experiment discard` no longer rewinds prior `keep` commits. On an `autoresearch/*` branch it now resets the worktree to `HEAD` (and `git clean`s untracked) instead of `git reset --hard $baseline_commit`. Discard reverts only the current iteration's uncommitted edits; previously kept improvements stay on the branch. `/autoresearch clear` continues to reset to the recorded baseline commit when explicitly requested.
- Autoresearch SQLite storage is now created lazily on first `init_experiment`. Running `omp` in a project that never invokes `/autoresearch` no longer creates a per-folder DB.

- Changed `search`, `find`, `ast_grep`, and `ast_edit` to accept `paths: string[]` instead of comma- or whitespace-delimited path strings.

### Added

- Added `update_notes` tool with `body` (replace) and `append_idea` (append a bullet under an `## Ideas` section). Notes are injected into the system prompt every iteration and replace the file-based `autoresearch.md` / `.program.md` / `.ideas.md` ecosystem.

### Changed

- Updated `log_experiment` summary output to include the count of scope deviations detected for a run
- Used the active session context in autoresearch resume instructions instead of referencing deleted repo-side files
- Removed `PI_STRICT_EDIT_MODE`; model-specific edit mode fallbacks are no longer disableable by environment flag.

### Fixed

- Atom edit auto-rebase warning now dedupes by `(originalLid, rebasedLine)` pair. Previously, `@Lid` followed by N `+TEXT` lines emitted N identical "Auto-rebased anchor" warnings (one per cloned cursor anchor); now emits exactly one per distinct rebase.
- Atom/hashline diff preview no longer renders deleted lines with a 2-space hash placeholder (`-20  |old`) that visually mimicked a Lid. Removed lines now use `--` as the placeholder (`-20--|old`), making them unambiguously non-Lid.
- Atom/hashline diff preview no longer folds size-mismatched `-`/`+` runs into a confusing mix of `*` (paired modification) lines plus surplus `-`/`+` lines. The `*` collapse now applies only to clean 1:1 line replacements (same number of dels and adds); range replaces with N→M (N≠M) render as plain unified-diff `-` then `+` runs.
- Atom edits now warn when `@Lid` lands on a brace-opening line and the inserted content is at sibling indent (≤ anchor indent) — a foot-gun where the agent meant `^<nextSibling>` but the inserts ended up as the first body element of the `{...}` block.
- Atom auto-fix warning for adjacent-duplicate cleanup is now formatted as `AUTO-FIX applied — verify the result. Removed ...` instead of the easier-to-miss `Auto-fixed: removed ...`, and explains that `{}/()/[]` balance was the trigger.
- Fixed multi-target `search`, `ast-grep`, and `ast-edit` path handling by running each resolved target separately under root-level path resolution
- Fixed pagination and match/replacement summaries for multi-target AST and text searches so totals and affected file counts include all targets
- Fixed returned file paths for multi-target `search` and `ast-grep` results by normalizing them to the original search scope
- Fixed `log_experiment keep` silently dropping the iteration's diff on an autoresearch branch. The previous logic filtered out every path that was already dirty when `run_experiment` ran — but in the iteration cycle the agent's edits always land before `run_experiment`, so the entire iteration was filtered away and nothing was committed. On an autoresearch branch, `keep` now treats every currently-dirty path as the iteration's change and commits it.

## [14.5.14] - 2026-05-01

### Changed

- Changed markdown conversion and archive tooling to defer loading heavy dependencies (Turndown, fflate, and browser agent content) until first use, reducing startup overhead for CLI startup and command initialization

### Fixed

- Fixed changelog state tracking by flushing `lastChangelogVersion` to settings immediately when showing new entries, so the updated version is persisted across restarts

## [14.5.13] - 2026-05-01

### Breaking Changes

- Removed the built-in `python` tool in favor of `eval`, so tool allowlists and tool-call handlers referencing `python` need to migrate
- Removed the `python.toolMode` setting and replaced mode control with separate `eval.py` and `eval.js` toggles
- Changed the tool runtime config surface by migrating `python` execution timeout/export behavior to `eval` and replacing `./ipy/*` internal exports with `./eval/*` paths
- Changed the `eval` tool wire format to a single `input` string composed of markdown fenced code blocks (with per-fence language, timeout, title, and reset metadata in the info string) instead of top-level `cells`, `language`, `timeout`, and `reset` fields

### Added

- Added a JavaScript backend to the `eval` tool with an in-process VM runtime and JS helper bridge (`read`, `write`, `glob`, etc.)
- Added `eval.py` and `eval.js` settings so Python and JavaScript `eval` backends can be enabled or disabled independently
- Added `rename_file` action to the Lsp tool to rename files and directories with LSP `workspace/willRenameFiles` and `workspace/didRenameFiles` flow, applying returned workspace edits before moving files
- Added `apply: false` preview mode for `rename_file` so users can see planned LSP edits without performing filesystem changes
- Added `request` action to invoke arbitrary LSP methods, with automatic `textDocument`/`position` parameter construction from `file`/`line`/`symbol` and support for explicit JSON `payload`
- Added `capabilities` action to display language server capabilities (for a file or all configured servers) through the LSP tool

### Changed

- Changed AGENTS.md discovery to respect `.gitignore` files during project context collection so ignored context files are no longer loaded
- Changed eval tool initialization to skip Python kernel preflight when the JavaScript backend is enabled, avoiding unnecessary startup checks
- Changed model registry refresh flow to defer rebuilding the canonical model index until refresh operations complete, reducing refresh churn
- Changed execution/tool discovery flow so `exec` maps to `eval` when any `eval` backend is enabled, while `bash` stays independently available
- Changed `eval` dispatch to automatically fall back to JavaScript when Python is unavailable and JavaScript backend is enabled
- Parallelized plugin root preloading with other startup initialization in `runRootCommand` to reduce startup latency
- Parallelized session bootstrap work in `createAgentSession`, including AGENTS.md scanning, context discovery, prompt template loading, slash command loading, and skill discovery, to reduce time to first available session

### Fixed

- Fixed eval startup messaging to report `eval` as unavailable when Python is unreachable and JavaScript backend is disabled

### Fixed

- Stabilized MCP tool ordering so reconnects and refreshes no longer reorder the tools array sent to the model. Anthropic prompt caching is keyed on byte-identical tool definitions; previously, the order depended on connection sequence and a single MCP server reconnect could shuffle tools across servers and invalidate the tools cache breakpoint.
- Skipped redundant system-prompt rebuilds in `AgentSession.refreshMCPTools` when the active tool set is unchanged. MCP transport flapping (e.g. routine 5-minute SSE reconnects) used to call `rebuildSystemPrompt` on every reconnect even though the resulting prompt was byte-identical, eating CPU and risking cache misses if the rebuild ever became non-deterministic. The applied-tool signature also covers `customWireName` so a wire-name flip with the rest of the tool metadata constant still forces a rebuild.

## [14.5.12] - 2026-04-30

### Breaking Changes

- Removed the legacy browser action verbs (`goto`, `observe`, `click`, `type`, `fill`, `press`, `scroll`, `drag`, `wait_for_selector`, `extract_readable`, and `screenshot`) in favor of invoking those workflows through `run`

### Added

- Added a `browser` tool `open`/`run`/`close` flow with a `run` action that executes async JavaScript and provides `page`, `browser`, `tab`, `display`, `assert`, and `wait` in scope
- Added named tabs on `open` with default name `main` so browser state can be reused across `run` calls and subagents
- Added support for `app.path` and `app.cdp_url` on `open` to launch/connect to CDP-capable desktop apps

### Changed

- Changed browser tool output rendering to display `run` calls as JavaScript code cells with status and output previews while showing `open`/`close` as compact status lines
- Changed `open` to open or reuse named tabs and `close` to support `all: true` and `kill`-based process termination behavior
- Changed app attachment behavior to reuse an existing CDP endpoint when available and avoid unnecessary respawn of matching app processes
- Changed tab closing so closing a tab no longer implicitly affects unnamed sessions when multiple tabs are used
- Changed browser export rendering to label outputs under the `browser` tool and include app metadata badges

### Fixed

- Fixed Electron/CDP attachment target selection to skip helper windows and pick the most likely user-visible page target
- Fixed connection startup by waiting for the CDP endpoint and surfacing a timeout error when it does not become available
- Fixed plan mode to auto-redirect `write` and `edit` calls targeting a bare `PLAN.md` (or any same-basename cwd-relative path) to the canonical `local://PLAN.md` plan artifact instead of rejecting them

## [14.5.11] - 2026-04-30

### Breaking Changes

- `todo_write`: renamed `replace` op to `init` and reshaped its input to `list: [{phase: string, items: string[]}]`. Tasks no longer accept a `status` field; all start `pending` and the first auto-promotes to `in_progress`. The `append` op's `items` is now `string[]` (was `{id, label}[]`)
- `todo_write`: removed the synthetic `task-N` / `phase-N` ids — task identity is now its `content` and phase identity is its `name`. The `task` field on `start`/`done`/`drop`/`note` and the `phase` field on `done`/`drop`/`rm`/`append` take those values directly
- `todo_write`: phase names no longer accept a numeric/roman prefix (`I.`, `1.`, `Phase 1:`, …). The renderer numbers phases visually (Ⅰ. Ⅱ. Ⅲ. …) and the model-facing state stores the bare noun phrase

### Changed

- Changed `/todo` task and phase operations to target items by fuzzy content or phase name matching instead of numeric IDs
- Changed initial todo markdown export template heading from `# I. Todos` to `# Todos`

### Fixed

- Fixed todo auto-clear scheduling to identify completed tasks by phase and content so only the matching task is cleared after delays

## [14.5.10] - 2026-04-30

### Breaking Changes

- Removed the `worktree` parameter from `github` `pr_checkout`. Worktrees are now always written to `~/.omp/wt/<encoded-primary-repo>/pr-<number>/`, derived from the primary repository path
- Stopped reading the `branch` parameter for `github` `pr_checkout`. The local branch is now always `pr-<number>`; the `branch` schema field is still accepted by `pr_push`, `repo_view`, and `run_watch`

### Added

- Added `checkouts` summary entries to `pr_checkout` results, including each checkout's branch, worktree path, remote, and reuse status
- Added combined summaries for `pr_view` and `pr_diff` when `pr` is an array, so multi-request responses now include all requested pull requests in one return
- Added array support to the `pr` parameter on `github` `pr_view`, `pr_diff`, and `pr_checkout` so a single call can fetch, diff, or check out multiple pull requests in one batch
- Added a per-repo serialization lock (`withRepoLock`) so concurrent `pr_checkout` calls against the same repository no longer race on git's internal `.git/config.lock`, commit-graph, and worktree lock files

### Changed

- Changed the diff preview shown after edits so changed lines are never collapsed: removed runs and the global preview budget no longer truncate, only unchanged context still collapses
- Changed adjacent `-`/`+` pairs in edit previews to fold into a single `*<line><hash>|<new-content>` modification line so 1:1 line replacements stay compact
- Changed `git.remote.add` to be idempotent when the remote already exists with the same URL (instead of failing with `remote ... already exists`), and to surface a clear error when the existing URL differs
- Changed `pr_checkout` to run `gh pr view` calls in parallel for batch invocations while serializing the in-repo git mutations to keep the operation race-free
- Changed `pr_checkout` to auto-derive the worktree location and local branch name (see Breaking Changes), removing the per-call overrides that previously let callers pin a worktree path or local branch

### Removed

- Removed the `./hooks` and `./hooks/*` package export entries
- Removed the `Suspicious duplicate` warning emitted after edits — it produced too many false positives (e.g. legitimate adjacent `\t});\n\t});`); the auto-fix path that uses bracket balance to safely de-duplicate is unchanged

### Fixed

- Fixed bash interceptor rules to also check the original command before `cd` normalization, so leading `cd ... &&` wrappers no longer bypass interception
- Fixed LSP client shutdown to properly await the language server's exit instead of fire-and-forget, preventing premature process termination on SIGINT and SIGTERM
- Fixed concurrent bash commands being tracked independently so aborting one no longer silently drops tracking of others

## [14.5.9] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Added the `/context` slash command to display an estimated context-usage breakdown panel for the current session
- Added `-LidA..LidB` syntax to delete inclusive line ranges in a single atom operation
- Added `LidA..LidB=TEXT` range-replace syntax with `\TEXT` and `\` continuation lines for multi-line replacement blocks
- Added shorthand cursor+insert operations in atom edits, including `^Lid` (insert before anchor), `^+TEXT`, `$+TEXT`, and `Lid+TEXT`/`@Lid+TEXT`
- Added standalone file-op fallback so `!rm` and `!mv DEST` inputs can be normalized into sections when using split input parsing

### Changed

- Changed token counting to use tokenizer-based estimates instead of a character-per-4 heuristic for context and compaction calculations
- Changed hashline anchor auto-rebase tolerance from ±2 lines to ±5 lines for stale Lid recovery
- Changed atom input handling so `#`-prefixed lines are treated as comments and ignored
- Changed execution when all edits are no-op `Lid=TEXT` replacements to return success with a no-change explanation instead of throwing

### Fixed

- Fixed malformed range and unified-diff-like atom syntax by rejecting reversed ranges, mismatched range endpoint hashes, and forms like `+Lid|TEXT`, `+Lid=TEXT`, and `-LidA..LidB|TEXT` with explicit actionable errors
- Fixed hash mismatch errors to include likely-shifted anchor hints when a unique matching line is found elsewhere in the file

## [14.5.8] - 2026-04-29

### Breaking Changes

- Changed the task runner toggle from `just.enabled` to `runCommand.enabled`, so existing configurations using `just.enabled` must be migrated
- Removed the legacy `just` tool and replaced it with `run_command`
- Renamed the built-in tool API from `just` to `run_command`, so clients requesting/handling the old tool name must update

### Added

- Added a new `run_command` tool that runs project tasks via a single `op` argument, auto-detecting and supporting recipes from justfiles, `package.json` scripts (including workspace packages), Cargo bin/example/test targets, Makefiles, and Taskfiles
- Added support for explicit runner-qualified tasks via `run_command` with `runnerId:task` syntax in the prompt guidance

### Changed

- Changed automatic tool availability so requesting `bash` can now auto-include `run_command` when a supported task runner manifest is detected in the working directory
- Changed task resolution to disambiguate identical task names across multiple runners and show runner-aware command execution errors

### Fixed

- Fixed editor draft being erased when a user message queued during streaming was eventually submitted; the queue/steer path now preserves any new prompt the user has typed since queuing, matching the existing optimistic-send protection.

## [14.5.7] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- Fixed hook editors to recognize Ctrl+Enter when terminals include NumLock or keypad Enter metadata.

## [14.5.6] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- Removed the atom edit mode's multi-anchor auto-rebase rejection so stale-but-uniquely-rebasable block edits apply with warnings instead of failing.

## [14.5.5] - 2026-04-29

### Breaking Changes

- Rejected atom diffs with unrecognized operations (including lone '-' lines) by throwing parse errors instead of treating them as inserts

### Added

- Added duplicate-line post-edit detection that warns on newly introduced adjacent identical lines and auto-removes one duplicate when bracket-balance is restored
- Added a warning when suspicious adjacent duplicates are introduced after edits so users can review potential stale-line issues

### Changed

- Changed anchor rebase handling to fail when multiple mutating anchors would need auto-rebase, preventing silent misapplied contiguous block rewrites

### Fixed

- Fixed bracket-corruption caused by botched block rewrites by automatically removing a newly introduced duplicate adjacent line when removing it restores the original `{}`, `()`, and `[]` balance and by warning when automatic removal is unsafe

## [14.5.4] - 2026-04-28

### Breaking Changes

- Changed the `atom` edit mode from JSON `{ path, edits }` calls to the compact file-oriented `input` patch language that was previously exposed as `atomd`; `atomd` is no longer a separate edit variant
- Renamed MCP tool identifiers from the `mcp_<server>_<tool>` format to `mcp__<server>_<tool>` so custom tool names, active tool lists, and persisted MCP selections must be updated to the new prefix
- Renamed the built-in content-search tool from `grep` to `search`, including SDK/tool event names and settings keys (`search.enabled`, `search.contextBefore`, `search.contextAfter`), so integrations using `grep` and `grep.*` references must be updated

### Added

- Added the `after_provider_response` extension event for observing provider response status, headers, and request IDs.
- Added internal URL support to the `search` tool, allowing `artifact://`-style paths that resolve to local files to be searched directly
- Added IRC relay observation in the main agent UI so every IRC exchange between agents is rendered in the main transcript, even when the main agent is not a direct participant
- Added stateful `href`/`hrefr` prompt helpers that can reuse anchors remembered from prior `hline` helper calls

### Changed

- Changed file-path rendering across search, find, AST, LSP, and related edit outputs to display targets as cwd-relative paths when they resolve inside the working directory and keep absolute paths for files outside the cwd
- Changed system prompt guidance so in-cwd tool paths must be passed as cwd-relative paths and absolute paths only for out-of-cwd targets or `~` expansion
- Updated `edit` streaming diff previews for `patch`, `replace`, and `hashline` to produce a single request-level preview for the new single-file `path` mode
- Bumped default `read.defaultLimit` from 300 to 500 lines, and scaled the read tool's byte budget with the line limit (`max(50KB, lines * 512)`) so the configured line count is no longer truncated by the shared 50KB cap

### Fixed

- Fixed atom edit streaming previews to use atom headers for file names instead of apply_patch parsing errors.
- Fixed collapsed search result rendering so summary and truncation rows stay within the collapsed output budget
- Updated search path handling to support path lists and internal file paths while preserving previous search behavior

## [14.5.3] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- Added bracketed `loc` forms `(anchor)`, `[anchor]`, `[anchor`, `(anchor`, `anchor]`, and `anchor)` to `atom` `splice` editing so a single anchor can target a block body, whole node, or partial node region
- Added automatic block-delimiter inference for block splices using file extension, defaulting to `{` and using `(` for Lisp-family files
- Added optional `pre`/`post` arguments to the `href` prompt helper so hashline references can be wrapped as bracketed or parenthesized anchors
- Added destination-aware indent handling for block replacements by detecting file indent style and reapplying tabs/spaces to spliced body text

### Changed

- Changed bracketed atom locators to be `splice`-only and reject `pre`, `post`, or `sed` on region locators
- Changed `applyAtomEdits` to forbid mixing `splice_block` with other anchor-scoped edit verbs in one call
- Changed `splice_block` resolution behavior to include selected block range and enclosing-count context in warning output
- Changed balanced-block parsing to support `kind` selection (`{`, `(`, `[`), nesting depth, and safer same-line enclosing selection

### Removed

- Removed the `sed` `F` option for literal matching; `sed` now accepts only `pat`, `rep`, and optional `g`, with `F`-style literal matching no longer supported

### Fixed

- Fixed `splice_block` multi-line replacements to replace the exact target region and avoid duplicate braces or duplicated signature lines from bare-anchor `splice` attempts
- Fixed false-positive “unbalanced” replacement-body warnings caused by braces in regex/string/comment text by skipping those constructs during block scanning
- Fixed `splice_block` for same-line `(` bodies so inline call sites like `int(port)` can be replaced correctly

## [14.5.2] - 2026-04-26

### Breaking Changes

- Removed support for sed-style string expressions and required `sed` to be specified as an object with `pat` and `rep` (and optional `g`, `F`, `i` flags)

### Changed

- Changed atom `sed` replacements to be global by default and require `g:false` for first-match-only replacements
- Changed anchor validation so multiple `sed` operations can target the same line and run sequentially
- Changed cross-entry conflict resolution so `del` edits on an anchor are ignored when that line is also replaced by `sed` or `splice` in another edit entry

### Fixed

- Fixed zero-length regex `sed` patterns (for example `()`, `^`, `$`) to fall back to literal substring matching instead of producing insertion-like replacements
- Fixed `sed` chaining so each edit on the same anchor applies to the latest line state from prior replacements

## [14.5.1] - 2026-04-26

### Removed

- Removed `\t` escaped-tab indentation autocorrect from hashline and atom edit modes (and the `PI_HASHLINE_AUTOCORRECT_ESCAPED_TABS` environment toggle); literal `\t` in edit content is now preserved verbatim
- Removed the suspicious-`\uDDDD` warning preflight from hashline edits
- Removed the hand-rolled JSON unescape fallback in the streaming edit-arg renderer; partial fragments that fail `JSON.parse` are now surfaced raw rather than partially decoded with a non-spec-compliant unescaper that mishandled lone surrogates

## [14.4.3] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- Added `irc` tool for agent-to-agent messaging with `list` and `send` operations, including optional broadcast to `all` and optional suppression of reply waits
- Added `irc.enabled` tool setting (default `true`) to toggle agent-to-agent messaging
- Added live in-chat rendering of IRC incoming and auto-reply messages so peer messages now appear in the session transcript

### Changed

- Changed peer-aware prompts for subagents to include currently live agent peers and IRC usage guidance when available
- Changed the `/btw` helper to use a session-side ephemeral turn path that preserves streaming-context handling and updates the existing request handling behavior
- Merged the `poll` and `cancel_job` tools into a single `job` tool that accepts `poll` and `cancel` arrays; the renamed tool reuses the richer poll renderer for both polling and cancellation calls

### Fixed

- Fixed IRC messaging to use a background ephemeral turn path so a recipient can reply even while its main loop is busy
- Fixed `/btw` handling of empty prompts and missing model configuration by rejecting invalid requests before starting a stream
- Fixed `/btw` request replacement so issuing a new query cleanly aborts the previous active request

## [14.4.2] - 2026-04-26

### Breaking Changes

- Changed `/todo append` from JSON payload input to `/todo append [<phase>] <task...>` with optional quoted tokens and automatic phase creation

### Added

- Added `note` to todo-write operations so you can append follow-up text notes to a task via `op: "note"` and `text`
- Added markdown note-block support to `/todo export` and `/todo import` so task notes are written as blockquote lines and reloaded with the todo list
- Added `/todo export <path>` to write the current todo list as Markdown to a file, defaulting to `TODO.md` when no path is provided
- Added `/todo import <path>` to replace the current todo list from a Markdown file, defaulting to `TODO.md` when no path is provided
- Added live poll progress updates so the UI now emits intermediate job state while waiting for jobs to finish
- Added a dedicated TUI renderer for the `poll` tool that displays job status, counts, duration, and result/error previews
- Added a `/todo` slash command to view and modify todos with `edit`, `copy`, `start`, `done`, `drop`, `rm`, `append`, and `replace` operations
- Added `/todo edit` to open the current todo list in `$EDITOR` as Markdown and sync the edited checklist back into the session
- Added `/todo copy` to copy the rendered Markdown todo list to the clipboard

### Changed

- Changed todo list rendering and summaries to show a `+N` note marker on task lines and display attached notes for tasks in progress
- Changed `/todo start`, `/todo done`, `/todo drop`, and `/todo rm` to resolve task/phase targets by fuzzy id/name matching instead of strict identifiers
- Removed `/todo replace` from supported slash commands
- Changed todo list restoration to include user todo-edit custom session entries so slash-command and editor-based todo updates persist after reload
- Restored sensible defaults for `grep.contextBefore` (1) and `grep.contextAfter` (3) so grep matches show context lines by default after the `pre`/`post` parameters were folded into settings

### Removed

- Removed the `chunk` edit mode, chunk-aware `read` selectors, chunk-aware `grep` rendering, and the `omp read` chunk CLI subcommand
- Removed the `read.prosechunks`, `read.explorechunks`, and `read.anchorstyle` settings
- Removed the underlying `chunk` native module and AST-based chunk schema generation from `pi-natives`

### Fixed

- Fixed poll final output to reflect live job data from the async job manager, improving status and result visibility
- Fixed job duration and output reporting to use current job snapshots instead of initial poll input metadata
- Fixed `poll` wait duration parsing to fall back to `30s` when the provided value is an empty string

## [14.4.1] - 2026-04-26

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced the legacy `gh_repo_view`, `gh_issue_view`, `gh_pr_view`, `gh_pr_diff`, `gh_pr_checkout`, `gh_pr_push`, `gh_run_watch`, `gh_search_issues`, and `gh_search_prs` tool names with only `github`, which requires updating existing callers that invoked the old `gh_*` tools

### Added

- Added a `sed` verb to the `atom` edit tool for line-local substitutions using sed-style syntax (`s/pattern/replacement/`) with `g`, `i`, and `F` flags and model-tolerant delimiter choices
- Added the unified `github` tool with op-based dispatch for repository, issue, pull request, search, checkout, push, and Actions watch workflows
- Added `op` routing so callers can select `repo_view`, `issue_view`, `pr_view`, `pr_diff`, `pr_checkout`, `pr_push`, `search_issues`, `search_prs`, or `run_watch` through a single tool entry point

### Changed

- Changed hashline-based read and match output formatting to use `LINE+ID|content` as the anchor/content separator, and updated match/context markers to `>` for matches and `:` for context
- Updated GitHub CLI render output to show `GitHub <op>` for tool calls dispatched through `github` operations

### Removed

- Removed the built-in `taplo` Language Server entry from default LSP settings, so TOML files no longer have default TOML server startup

### Fixed

- Fixed `atom` `loc` parsing so path-qualified anchors like `path:263ti| ...` and single-anchor locs containing hyphens no longer mis-parse as ranges
- Fixed hashline anchor handling in `atom` edits so a provided content hint after the anchor (`|` or `:` suffix) can rebond a stale hash to the intended line
- Fixed `atom` `sed` execution to tolerate common model-emitted forms such as `/pat/rep/`, and to apply safe literal fallbacks for regex failures or metacharacter-heavy patterns while still erroring when no match is possible

## [14.4.0] - 2026-04-26

### Breaking Changes

- Removed multi-pattern array input from `ast_grep` by changing `pat` to a single pattern string, so call sites using `pat: [...]` must be updated to send one query per invocation
- Removed `lang`, `glob`, and `sel` options from `ast_edit` and `ast_grep`, and moved those behaviors into the required `path` argument
- Required `path` for `ast_edit` and `ast_grep`, so invocations that relied on implicit repo-root searching are no longer valid
- Changed `todo_write` from multi-field verb payloads to an ordered array of flat operations, while retaining `replace` for harness bootstrap compatibility
- Renamed atom edit operations from `before` and `after` to `pre` and `post`, so existing `atom` payloads using the old operation keys must be updated
- Changed the hashline anchor format from `LINE#ID:content` to `LINEID:content` (no `#` separator, colon between anchor and content, no padding on line numbers); expanded the bigram alphabet from 40 hand-picked English bigrams to the full 647 single-token 2-letter bigrams — invalidates every previously captured `LINE#ID` reference
- Renamed the subagent completion contract from `submit_result` to `yield`, so subagent sessions must now finish with the `yield` tool and the `requireYieldTool` option; `submit_result`/`requireSubmitResultTool` and old completion calls are no longer recognized
- Changed the hashline and chunk anchor ID format from the prior hex-like tokens to two-letter BPE bigrams (for example `#th`), which invalidates previously captured `LINE#ID`/chunk selectors and requires re-reading to refresh anchors

### Added

- Added inline file overrides in atom locators (`loc: "a.ts:160sr"`) so cross-file edits can be written without a separate per-entry `path` field
- Added `openai` to the `providers.image` options, allowing image generation to be explicitly routed through the active GPT Responses/Codex model
- Added `between` atom edit operation to replace only the lines between two surviving anchors while preserving the boundary anchors
- Added conflict detection for `between` atom edits to require non-overlapping regions and forbid edits targeting lines strictly inside those regions
- Added `atom` edit mode to `edit` with single-anchor operations (`set`, `before`, `after`, `del`, `sub`, `ins`) for hashline-anchored line edits
- Added support for request-level `path` defaults in patch, replace, and chunk edits so shared file paths no longer need to be repeated in every entry

### Changed

- Updated `atom` and `hashline` edit anchor validation to auto-rebase a stale anchor within ±2 lines when the same hash matches a unique nearby line, continuing the edit with a warning instead of immediate failure
- Changed bash command output labels from `[full result: artifact://…]` to `[raw output: artifact://…]` for artifact references produced from large command output
- Changed `todo_write` `done`, `rm`, and `drop` operations to target all tasks when neither `task` nor `phase` is provided, and made `append` create the target phase automatically when missing
- Updated `ast_edit` and `ast_grep` to pass file-selection intent through `path` (including inline globs and comma/space-separated path lists) instead of separate `glob` filters
- Changed `ast_grep` pagination API from `offset` to `skip`
- Flattened `todo_write` operation arguments to `{ op, task?, phase?, items? }[]` and removed task details from the persisted todo shape
- Changed `grep` truncation output to report `Result limit reached; narrow path.` and label match/result caps as `first N`
- Changed JSON tree output to truncate inline argument pairs by available width and add an ellipsis when values no longer fit in the display
- Changed JSON tree rendering to hide harness-internal `intent` and `__partialJson` fields from top-level tool output
- Simplified the `grep` tool schema by requiring `path`, folding glob and type filtering into path globs, auto-detecting multiline patterns, removing model-controlled context and limit options, and renaming result skipping to `skip`.
- Changed atom edit request format to use a shared `loc` selector, including range (`"160sr-9ab"`) and boundary (`"^"`, `"$"`) forms instead of per-operation anchor fields
- Changed atom edit payload fields so `set`, `pre`, and `post` now require line-array values and `sub` now takes a `[find, replace]` tuple, with boundary deletion now expressed as `set: []`
- Changed edit diff wrapping to preserve the active line-prefix separator (`|` or `│`) while keeping continuation lines aligned by line-number width
- Changed Vim focus and viewport rendering to align cursor/selection markers and line numbers in a single gutter format
- Changed auto image provider selection for `providers.image=auto` to try active GPT image generation before Antigravity, OpenRouter, and Gemini
- Updated atom and hashline anchor validation to require the full `line+suffix` anchor format and report missing-line-number errors more clearly, including guidance when only a 2-letter suffix is provided
- Changed read, grep, and ast-edit line-prefixed output to drop fixed-width line number padding, so anchors render in natural width without leading spaces
- Updated terminal diff rendering to use a continuous `│` gutter and hide repeated line numbers on adjacent diff lines
- Updated subagent reminders, prompts, and rendered subagent output to reference `yield` completion and report missing/final results from `yield` tool data
- Updated the `edit` workflow to treat `atom` mode like hashline mode for read output, so hashline anchors are shown when `atom` is selected
- Adjusted patch/replace/chunk tooling to accept optional entry paths and to apply a top-level path default
- Updated hashline/chunk selector parsing to the new stable bigram token set used for checksums
- Renamed the image generation implementation module to `image-gen` and routed active GPT Responses/Codex models through OpenAI's hosted `image_generation` tool with WebP output

### Removed

- Removed line-range support from `atom` mode selectors, including `loc` values like `160sr-170ab`, so edits must target a single anchor (`160sr`, `^`, or `$`) per entry
- Removed the atom `del` verb and now require anchored-line deletion to be requested with `set: []`
- Removed `todo_write` task details and the `add_notes` operation

### Fixed

- Improved no-op edit diagnostics for `atom` and `hashline` operations so edits that leave content unchanged now fail with contextual details (edit index, locator, and reason), including guidance for `replace_range` no-op cases
- Wrapped `todo_write` operations in an `ops` object so Codex/OpenAI function schemas always use a JSON Schema object.
- Fixed JSON tree rendering for tool arguments by excluding injected internal keys from displayed root records
- Printed assistant `errorMessage` text in print mode output to stderr so message-level errors are visible during non-interactive runs
- Displayed assistant `errorMessage` text in the assistant message component for completed tool responses with non-terminal stop reasons
- Fixed atom input handling to ignore null optional verb fields so entries with `pre`, `set`, `post`, or `sub` set to `null` remain valid
- Fixed status-line Git branch rendering to degrade gracefully when the process hits `ENFILE`/`EMFILE` while reading optional Git refs
- Changed hashline mismatch failure output to show a clean numbered context block with numbered gutter and full-anchor alignment guidance when edits are rejected after the file changed
- Fixed `atom` mode to apply multiple edits on the same anchor line without index-shift artifacts, so mixed operations like `before`, `after`, `set`, `sub`, `ins`, and `del` now resolve consistently
- Fixed `atom` mode `append_file` insertion to preserve a file’s trailing newline sentinel when appending content
- Fixed `read` output for raw archive entries so hashline anchors, line numbers, and chunked formatting are not injected into raw content
- Fixed hashline parsing so lines like `# Note:` or `# TODO:` are no longer misinterpreted and stripped as hashline prefixes
- Adjusted patch and replace validation to report a clear missing-path error when neither an entry path nor a top-level path is provided

## [14.3.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- Added Markdown pipe-table `row_N` chunk selectors for row-level table edits.
- Added `resolveToolAlias` export so tool names in CLI and session setup are normalized to canonical names, including mapping legacy `read` references to `open`
- Added new `open` and `open-chunk` tool prompt documentation pages to describe canonical `open` usage for local files/directories, chunk reads, and URLs
- Added full-output retrieval metadata to minimized shell command output by appending an `artifact://<id>` footer with byte counts, allowing users to open the original unminimized command output
- Added streaming preview API exports from the package (`resolveEditMode`, `EDIT_MODE_STRATEGIES`, and chunk preview helpers) so editors can reuse mode-aware edit preview logic programmatically
- Added `shellMinimizer` configuration options (`enabled`, `settingsPath`, `only`, `except`, and `maxCaptureBytes`) so users can control shell output minimization behavior

### Changed

- Changed the canonical file/URL reader tool from `read` to `open` across default tool lists and routing, including system prompts, plan mode, cursor handlers, and runtime tool registration
- Changed runtime and UI handling to render and track `open` tool calls as first-class (with `read` accepted as legacy alias), including ACP mapping, session observers, and streaming message groups
- Changed chunk edit guidance to document parser-specific region behavior, including TypeScript decorator/JSDoc sibling chunks, Python docstrings as body content, Python opaque nested chunks, Markdown whole-chunk fallbacks, ID volatility, and indentation display differences
- Changed chunk deletion in chunk edit mode to require explicit `delete: true`; `write: null` and bare `{ path }` entries now fail with guidance instead of deleting content.
- Changed chunk edit validation to reject entries with multiple operation fields instead of choosing one and ignoring the rest.
- Changed chunk edit validation to reject `write: ""` as an accidental destructive empty replacement; use the open tool for inspection or `delete: true` for deletion.
- Changed chunk edit responses to warn when appending or prepending to a container without `~`, since that inserts outside the container rather than inside its body.
- Changed fetch output logging so URL-fetch artifacts now use `.open.log` naming instead of `.read.log`
- Changed Bash interception guidance and errors to recommend `open` in place of `read` for cat/head/tail-style commands
- Changed exported SDK tool surface to expose `OpenTool` as canonical and keep `ReadTool` as a compatibility alias
- Changed session list loading to use parallel workers and fixed-size prefix reads per session file, reducing latency when loading many or large sessions
- Changed edit call rendering to use mode-aware streaming diff previews, including multi-file chunk edit previews grouped by file path while arguments are still streaming
- Changed shell execution in both interactive and non-interactive modes to route command output through the configured shell output minimizer
- Changed default behavior so shell output minimization can now be toggled from settings without code changes
- Changed shell output minimization to leave compound and piped commands unchanged; only a single eligible whole command is captured and minimized after it exits

### Removed

- Removed the chunk edit `read: true` operation; use the open tool to inspect chunks without modifying files.
- Removed the `replace: { old, new }` chunk edit operation. Use `write` or `insert` for chunk edits instead.

### Fixed

- Fixed startup crashes on Linux systems where Bun's `os.cpus()` fails on non-contiguous CPU numbering ([#779](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/779))
- Fixed `gh_pr_push` so branches without `gh_pr_checkout` metadata fail instead of falling back to the tracked merge branch, and updated the GitHub tool setting copy to stop calling the tool group read-only ([#778](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/778))
- Fixed session list metadata extraction to better populate session titles and first-user summaries from partial session data when full JSONL parsing is unavailable
- Fixed shell execution output to replace raw streamed bash output with the minimizer’s rewritten text before final output while still preserving the full original output as artifact metadata
- Fixed bash command minimization to save the full unminimized output as a `bash-original` artifact during AgentSession shell execution, enabling `artifact://` access to complete command output
- Fixed streaming chunk previews that could display an incomplete trailing edit as a deletion when partial JSON temporarily converted in-flight values to `null`
- Fixed edit streaming preview updates to cancel obsolete in-flight computations and avoid rendering stale previews as args change
- Fixed chunk edits to reject unsafe `^`/`~` writes on code leaf chunks instead of falling back to whole-chunk replacement and risking structural indentation corruption
- Fixed chunk `replace` operations to dedent multiline replacement snippets before reapplying the matched source indentation, preventing Python nested replacements from compounding indentation on repeated edits.
- Fixed Go chunk trees to classify `package` clauses separately from imports and to avoid duplicating method receivers in method summaries.
- Fixed chunk path-not-found guidance so it recommends `sel="?"` without claiming the already-shown listing must be re-read.
- Fixed Markdown chunk appends to preserve blank-line separators after line-oriented inserts such as table rows
- Fixed Markdown section region-fallback warnings to call out child chunks that will be replaced by whole-section edits.
- Fixed rejected chunk-edit errors to distinguish current file content from hypothetical post-edit parse-error previews and to state when a same-file batch was rolled back.
- Fixed unsafe Python head-region edits by rejecting decorated Python `^` writes and Python `^` deletes that can orphan indented bodies while still parsing.
- Fixed Markdown table-row appends so row-shaped content lands inside the table block instead of after the trailing blank-line separator.
- Fixed Markdown root writes to preserve fenced-code indentation verbatim.
- Fixed Rust enum-variant replacement matching so trailing commas are included consistently with whole-variant writes.
- Fixed streaming edit call headers to keep showing the target file path while the edit arguments are still arriving
- Fixed Mermaid fenced markdown rendering in assistant messages on terminals without image protocol support ([#650](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/650))
- Fixed chunk edit path parsing so plan-mode edits to section-addressed `local://PLAN.md:<selector>` paths are classified as writes to the plan file
- Fixed SQLite `read` helper queries to reject `where=` clauses with SQL control syntax that could override the structured selector's pagination; raw SQL remains available through `q=SELECT ...`
- Fixed `models` provider transport overrides so `headers`-only entries apply without requiring `baseUrl`, including runtime `registerProvider()` overrides that now persist across `refresh()` / `refreshProvider()`, preserve existing `baseUrl` on subsequent headers-only updates, clear stale transport overrides when a provider is re-registered under a different extension source, and keep runtime transport headers authoritative when `modelOverrides` set overlapping header keys

## [14.2.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- Added an `apply_patch` edit mode that accepts Codex `*** Begin Patch` envelopes, shares patch-mode execution and diagnostics, and renders streaming per-file diffs in the TUI.

### Changed

- Changed Spark models to default to `apply_patch` edit mode instead of `replace`.
- Tightened the contract for `SearchParams.recency` in `web/search/providers/base.ts`: providers MUST interpret recency as a pure time filter and MUST NOT use it as an implicit signal to change topic scope, content domain, or ranking strategy.
- Inline read tool previews are now optional via `read.toolResultPreview` and default to off

### Fixed

- Fixed `apply_patch` streaming previews to avoid showing the missing `*** End Patch` parse error while the patch body is still arriving.
- Fixed diagnostics rendering to replace tabs before TUI output, preventing compiler messages from breaking tree alignment.
- Fixed compiled `omp` binaries to ignore project-local `bunfig.toml` and `.env` autoloading at startup, preventing unrelated project config from crashing or preloading code into the CLI
- Fixed edit tool diff and replace operations to report missing-file failures as `File not found: <path>` errors instead of raw filesystem ENOENT errors
- Fixed `local://` URL path leak on Linux where `//` collapsing to `/` produced `local:/path` forms that bypassed the internal protocol handler and leaked as filesystem paths, breaking plan mode file resolution
- Fixed Darwin compiled binaries failing to start under Bun 1.3.12 by ad-hoc signing local and release binary builds after applying Bun's no-codesign workaround ([#754](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/754))
- Fixed Tavily web search silently returning off-topic news articles when `--recency` was set. The provider was unconditionally coupling `topic: "news"` to recency, which scoped Tavily's index to news publications and excluded documentation, release notes, GitHub, and all non-news technical content. Technical queries with `--recency` now return the correct corpus.
- Fixed status-line sanitization to strip OSC, DCS, PM, APC, and 8-bit CSI escape sequences instead of leaving payload fragments in the UI
- Fixed inline read tool previews to avoid rendering duplicate summary rows above the same code cell

## [14.1.3] - 2026-04-17

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced the legacy `todo_write` `ops`-based API (`replace`, `update`, `add_task`, and `remove_task`) with direct top-level fields, requiring migration of any callers using the old request shape
- Removed in-place updates to existing task `content`, `details`, and `notes` via `todo_write`; note changes now append through `add_notes`
- Phased task definitions in `todo_write` now reject `notes` on initial creation, so notes must be added later with `add_notes`

### Added

- Added `complete`, `start`, `abandon`, `remove`, `add_notes`, and `add_tasks` parameters to `todo_write` so callers can complete, jump to, drop, and annotate tasks without op wrappers
- Added direct `add_phase` support as a top-level argument for inserting a new phase in `todo_write`
- Added `task.simple` with `default`, `schema-free`, and `independent` modes so the task tool can disable task-call `schema` and shared `context` inputs while preserving agent-defined and inherited subagent schemas

### Changed

- Changed `add_tasks` to insert tasks by phase name or ID and allow multiple tasks to be added in one call

### Fixed

- Fixed task calls in `schema-free` and `independent` modes to return clear mode-specific errors when disallowed `context` or `schema` inputs are provided
- Fixed newly generated session IDs to use UUIDv7 for new, forked, and branched sessions while preserving resumed session IDs

## [14.1.1] - 2026-04-14

### Breaking Changes

- Removed the standalone `vim` tool from built-in tool lists, so vim-style editing is now invoked through `edit` in `vim` mode
- Removed the `searchDb` field from session and extension tool contexts, so custom tools and extensions no longer receive a shared native search DB handle from `ToolSession`, `CustomToolContext`, `ExtensionContext`, and `CreateAgentSessionOptions`
- Changed the `vim` tool API to require either `open: "path"` or `kbd: [...]` per call and removed direct `line`/`col` cursor parameters from `open`, so callers must position the cursor via key sequences after opening
- Changed the `edit` schemas for patch, replace, hashline, and chunk modes from top-level request fields to `edits` array entries, requiring path/mode details on each edit and breaking callers that send legacy top-level `path`, `old_text`, `new_text`, `op`, `move`, or `delete` payloads

### Added

- Added Vim ex aliases `:del`, `:ya`, `:co`, and `:mo` as shorthand for existing delete, yank, copy, and move commands
- Added support for additional Vim ex command aliases `:write`/`write!`, `:edit`/`edit!`, and `:update`/`:up` in command parsing
- Added support for vim `:global` and `:vglobal`/`/` variants as `:g/pattern/d` and `:v/pattern/d` parsing and execution
- Added support for extra Vim operations by treating `x`, `X`, `s`, `S`, `C`, and `D` as delete/change operator aliases
- Added support for new Vim motions `gE`/`ge`, `g_`, `g*`, `g#`, and `|`
- Added support for `C-f` and `C-b` page motions in vim mode
- Added `C-u` and `C-o` in vim insert mode to clear to line start and execute a one-off normal-mode command before returning to insert
- Added insert-mode visual operators `J`, `u`, `U`, `p`, and `P` to join lines, convert case, and replace the selected region with register content
- Added normal-mode line motions `+`, `-`, and `_` to move to line offsets at the first non-blank character
- Added `*` and `#` normal-mode commands to search forward or backward for the word under the cursor
- Added `gJ` to join a line range, `gv` to restore the last visual selection, and `ZZ`/`ZQ` shortcuts for save-and-exit or exit-without-save in vim mode
- Added paragraph text object `p` for `ip`/`ap`-style paragraph selection
- Added support for Vim ex line-address forms like `.`, `$`, `+N`/`-N`, destination addresses such as `:t$`, and ranged `:global` commands
- Added Vim ex `:join`/`:j` and `:join!`/`:j!` support to join addressed lines with or without whitespace normalization
- Added a warning when chunk edits write to the `~` selector with body lines that appear over-indented, instructing users to start top-level body text at column 0
- Added validation feedback for suspect indentation in chunk-mode `~` body writes so users can align content with the tool's automatic base indentation
- Added support for multi-file `edit` calls across replace, patch, hashline, and chunk modes by grouping `edits` entries by file path and returning combined per-file results
- Added per-edit `path` support in chunk entries so each operation can target explicit files when submitting mixed edits in a single request
- Added support for `computeHashlineDiff` to accept hashline edits with `loc` and `content` payloads without requiring pre-resolved `op` fields
- Added `/rename <title>` slash command to set an explicit session name, updating the session header and terminal tab title ([#658](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/658))
- Added `session_name` status line segment: displays the session name in the status bar right side with a stable hash-derived accent color unique to each name; shown in all presets when a name is set

### Changed

- Changed vim path normalization to accept colon-prefixed `path` values instead of rejecting them as Vim commands
- Changed default `providers.openaiWebsockets` setting to `off` when unset, so OpenAI websocket transport is now disabled unless explicitly enabled
- Changed Vim ex `:update`/`:up` execution to skip writing unchanged buffers and report buffer unchanged status
- Changed Vim page-scroll commands `C-f`, `C-b`, `C-u`, and `C-d` to move in viewport-height based increments instead of fixed constants
- Changed `z` command behavior so `zt`, `zb`, and `z.` now align cursor movement to first non-blank in the line
- Changed `:g`/`:v` global command handling to process matching lines safely by working in reverse order and preserving file structure
- Changed vim tab breadcrumb rendering from `→` to `→` in the editor view
- Changed custom tool and task execution contexts to no longer expose a shared `searchDb` accessor, removing direct access to native grep/glob/fuzzyFind search backends from extension callbacks
- Changed the `task` tool `schema` field to require JSON-encoded JTD schema text instead of a schema object, matching prompt guidance and task-subagent invocation
- Changed chunk edit payloads to encode selectors as `path: "file:selector"` and updated chunk tool guidance and examples to match
- Updated `edit` call/result rendering to show per-file diff sections and append a `(+N more)` hint when edits target multiple files
- Grouped chunk-mode `grep` results by directory, file, and chunk so directory searches now render as hierarchical sections (`#`/`##`) with per-chunk anchor lines
- Updated chunk-mode `grep` output to include match lines under their containing chunk entries with consistent line-number alignment based on file length
- Changed eager todo enforcement to only apply on the first user message of a conversation, skipping subsequent user turns that may correct, clarify, or redirect the prior task

### Removed

- Removed live in-progress Vim tool previews during streaming call execution, so the TUI now shows only the last completed file viewport until the call finishes

### Fixed

- Fixed vim-mode multi-step line edits by auto-reordering ascending line-positioned commands to descending order before execution
- Fixed Vim viewport rendering to display the inline highlighted cursor character and keep long cursor lines centered around the cursor in tool previews
- Fixed Vim `:global` command defaults to handle only supported subcommands and report unsupported ones explicitly
- Fixed Vim ex execution so parsed `:update`, `:yank`, and `:put` commands now run instead of falling through
- Fixed vim tool rendering so streamed calls preview the live target viewport and large insert payloads update incrementally instead of popping in all at once
- Fixed session event delivery so streaming `message_update`/tool-call previews reach the TUI immediately instead of waiting for extension handlers to finish
- Fixed HTML session export rendering so background-job wait calls render as `poll` instead of stale `await`, while still recognizing legacy exported sessions
- Fixed OpenRouter model resolution to accept dated routed selectors such as `openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7-20251222:nitro`, inheriting metadata from the base catalog model when the exact variant is not listed yet
- Fixed pre-execution edit preview routing so replace/patch/hashline mode diffs are computed from the new structured edit entries
- Adjusted chunk/hashline/prompt guidance and validation to align with the refactored per-entry schema
- Fixed chunk streaming output detection to verify chunk edits with `chunkToolEditSchema`, preventing non-chunk edit payloads from being rendered as chunk diffs
- Fixed tool execution output to return the original `toolResult` text content from tools instead of sanitizing it before sending completion messages
- Fixed session accent rendering in the status line and editor to reset only foreground color (`\x1b[39m`) so applying a session color no longer clears other ANSI styles
- Session name sanitization: strip C0/C1 control characters (including ANSI ESC) from session names at storage time and in status line rendering, preventing escape sequence injection into TUI output
- Auto-generated session titles no longer overwrite a name set via `/rename`: `setSessionName` now tracks whether the name was set by the user or auto-generated and silently ignores auto titles once a user name is in place; terminal title follows the same guard
- Session accent border color now applied on session resume and after auto-title generation, not only after an explicit `/rename`
- Fixed retained Python kernel ownership so `AgentSession.dispose()` only shuts down kernels owned by that session, including warmup-created kernels

## [14.1.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- Added richer tool rendering details in session export HTML, including metadata badges, argument formatting, and todo task tree styling for exported tool and workflow messages
- Added a persistent `js` tool backed by `node:vm`, with cross-session `highway` KV/pubsub, tool calls from inside JS cells, and `$` / `$$` interactive JavaScript execution
- Added SQLite database read support to the `read` tool for `.sqlite`, `.sqlite3`, `.db`, and `.db3` files with table listing, schema + sample output, row lookup, paginated query filtering, and read-only `q=SELECT` mode
- Added SQLite mutation support to the `write` tool so `db.sqlite:table` inserts JSON5 rows and `db.sqlite:table:key` updates or deletes rows via row key
- Added rendering of usage report entries for accounts with no usage limits, including account label and optional plan type with a `-- no limits` indicator
- Updated account label resolution to fall back to email or accountId so unlabeled unlimited-plan accounts display a meaningful name
- Added canonical model equivalence and provider coalescing across `models.yml`, `enabledModels`, `--models`, `/model`, and `--list-models`
- Added `equivalence` overrides/exclusions to `models.yml` and `modelProviderOrder` to `config.yml` for global canonical-provider preference

### Changed

- Enabled `await` and `cancel_job` to be available when `bash.autoBackground.enabled` is set, so auto-backgrounded bash jobs can be awaited or cancelled without enabling `async.enabled`
- Updated bash auto-background behavior so short commands returned inline output when they completed before the configured threshold, while longer runs moved to background jobs automatically
- Replaced the LLM-callable Python execution path with JavaScript execution in the shared VM context, including updated renderers, prompts, session messages, and extension events
- Updated interactive and CLI model listings/selectors to work with canonical model ids while resolving them to concrete provider variants for actual execution
- Updated role assignment persistence so selected model settings now store the selector used by users, including thinking-level suffixes, while runtime continues to run against the resolved concrete provider model
- Updated model scope resolution to expand exact canonical model ids into all matching provider variants when filtering supported model sets
- Changed the agent to avoid giving time estimates or task-duration predictions in user responses, focusing on required work instead
- Changed generated code guidance to avoid speculative abstractions and extra compatibility scaffolding, favoring direct implementations that match current needs
- Changed model role resolution so roles can store either canonical model ids or explicit `provider/model` selectors while sessions continue to record the concrete model actually used
- Updated bash execution to optionally auto-background long-running commands through the existing background-job pipeline, with dedicated settings for enabling the behavior and adjusting the delay

### Fixed

- Fixed session export rendering so JavaScript execution messages now use `jsExecution` labels and content instead of `pythonExecution`, matching current tool behavior
- Fixed JavaScript cell execution to auto-display returned values once and preserve persistent VM bindings across calls until reset
- Fixed `.db`/`.db3` reads to verify SQLite file headers and fall back to normal file reading when the extension matches but the content is not a SQLite database
- Fixed SQLite selector parsing and resolution to correctly route requests to database operations at the file-extension boundary instead of misrouting through plain file/archive handlers
- Fixed unsupported or unsafe selectors by rejecting missing tables, composite primary keys for row lookups, unknown query parameters, and row operations on non-existent tables
- Fixed model resolution for commit message generation, title generation, memory consolidation, and image inspection when role strings use canonical ids instead of raw provider/model values
- Fixed default-model updates so previously configured thinking levels were preserved when reassigning a role
- Fixed model scope and selection handling in CLI/session startup paths that previously failed to resolve aliases consistently across features
- Fixed short-lived git subprocesses to disable `core.fsmonitor` and `core.untrackedCache`, avoiding unnecessary repository watchers and cache work during agent git operations

### Security

- Blocked destructive SQL execution in read-mode SQLite access by using read-only connections and rejecting bound-parameter raw SQL

- Reduced default image resize limits to 1568px (from 2000px) and 500KB (from 4.5MB) to match Anthropic's internal downscaling threshold and reduce payload sizes in tool calls
- Adjusted screenshot compression to use 1024px max dimensions and 150KB budget for more aggressive optimization of browser screenshots in LLM requests
- Updated JPEG quality defaults from 80 to 75 and refined quality ladder steps (70, 60, 50, 40) for tighter byte budgets
- Improved image resize fast-path to skip re-encoding when images are already within dimensions and at ≤25% of byte budget, avoiding unnecessary processing of small icons and diagrams
- Clarified that chunk names are truncated and must be copied from `read` or `?` output rather than constructed from source identifiers
- Enhanced guidance for editing fenced code blocks in markdown to preserve exact whitespace using `raw` reads, as the tool normalizes tabs to spaces which can damage indentation-sensitive content
- Updated designer agent to use `pi/designer` role alias instead of explicit model list
- Refactored model role resolution to support multiple fallback patterns per role, improving model availability handling
- Replaced regex-based HTML-to-markdown conversion with Turndown library and GFM plugin for more accurate formatting of complex HTML structures

- Refactored diagnostic target resolution to use new `resolveDiagnosticTargets` function, consolidating glob pattern detection and file matching logic
- Updated chunk selector syntax from `@region` format to `~` (body) and `^` (head) suffixes for more concise region targeting
- Simplified chunk edit documentation to use new `~` and `^` region syntax instead of `@head`, `@body`, `@tail`, `@decl` keywords
- Replaced internal `raceAbort` function with imported `raceWithAbort` utility from pi-utils
- Refactored cleanup timer to use async iterator pattern with `timers.setInterval` instead of `setInterval`
- Made `#cleanupIdleSessions` synchronous and moved async cleanup loop logic to new `#runCleanupLoop` method
- Replaced regex-based `htmlToBasicMarkdown` with a Turndown + GFM plugin pipeline (tables, strikethrough, task lists, nested lists now convert correctly). Added direct `turndown` and `turndown-plugin-gfm` dependencies

### Fixed

- Fixed chunk edit tool to report file-not-found error distinctly when attempting to use chunk selectors on non-existent files, with guidance to use write tool or verify the path
- Fixed stale child selector reuse to correctly match chunks by checksum when multiple sibling chunks with the same name exist under the same parent
- Fixed stale diagnostics being reused after unrelated file publishes by clearing cached diagnostics before refreshing file state
- Fixed Codex search to use streamed answer text when final answer is an image placeholder or empty

### Fixed

- Fixed MCP config docs and schema to use `~/.omp/agent/mcp.json` for user-scoped OMP-native MCP config while keeping project config at `<cwd>/.omp/mcp.json`

- Chunk read output now displays fully-qualified anchor paths (e.g., `[class_Worker.fn_run#CRC]`) instead of bare names, making targets unambiguous for edits
- Chunk edit tool documentation clarified: `target` must be the fully-qualified path with `#CRC` suffix; added guidance to run `read(path="file", sel="?")` for canonical target listings when anchor style is unclear
- Chunk read tool documentation updated: `sel` parameter now documents the `?` selector for canonical target listings, and clarifies that default output shows full paths
- Chunk edit schema and tool contract: explicit `op` (`replace`, `append`, `prepend`, `after`, `before`); use `replace` with empty `content` to remove a chunk (no separate `delete` op); sibling inserts use `anchor` instead of separate after/before target fields; insert ops omit CRC where appropriate, mutations require checksum on target
- Chunk path handling: parse selector and CRC separately, sanitize selectors (strip filename prefixes, uppercase checksums), accept embedded `#CRC` on targets, auto-accept stale CRC for later ops in the same batch on the same chunk
- Chunk UX: streaming and final edit previews show chunk edits next to hashline edits with op-specific labels; prompt docs shortened with rules table, `…` in examples, and helper-based path/anchor samples
- `log_experiment` only reverts files modified by the run; prompts and errors document that pre-existing dirty files are preserved; richer pending-run error context; `init_experiment` no-ops when the contract matches unless `new_segment`; secondary metrics informational only (no `force` for drift)
- Autoresearch: `log_experiment` reloads benchmark/scope/constraints from `autoresearch.md` after resolving a pending run; `/autoresearch` without `autoresearch.md` follows `/plan`-style toggle and message flow; setup moved into autoresearch system prompt (removed `command-initialize.md`)
- Native/shell alignment: `GrepOutputMode` from pi-natives; shell and `getDiagnosticsForFile` callbacks use error-first `(err, chunk)`; `getDiagnosticsForFile` takes an options object
- Clipboard: `copyToClipboard` / `readImageFromClipboard` live in `utils/clipboard.ts` (OSC 52 and Termux)
- macOS: session-wide power assertion while the agent runs; `MacAppearanceObserver.start()` with error-first callback; `detectMacOSAppearance()` returns enum values
- ACP session cleanup now properly cancels in-flight prompts and disposes resources when sessions are closed or connection aborts
- Removed unused `_createErrorToolResult` helper function from RPC host-tools module
- Fixed Go receiver method indentation in append operations to preserve relative indentation from the anchor chunk
- Fixed Go type chunk line counts to report only the type body lines instead of including grouped receiver methods
- Fixed enum variant insertion to avoid adding extra blank lines between variants
- Chunk read output now correctly preserves embedded CRC in selectors (e.g., `class_Foo.fn_bar#ZZPM`) instead of stripping them during path parsing
- Chunk edit error messages now consistently report checksum mismatches with format `Checksum mismatch` instead of variable phrasing
- Chunk-mode read output now correctly displays scoped response trees showing only touched chunks and adjacent siblings, preventing unrelated distant chunks from appearing in responses
- DAP stopped event handling no longer blocks the message reader, preventing potential deadlocks during rapid event sequences
- Chunk-mode whole-chunk replaces now preserve attached leading comments and docblocks when replacement content starts at the declaration, preventing accidental comment loss during agent edits
- Chunk edit error messages now consistently report checksum mismatches with the format `did not match checksum "XXXX"` instead of variable phrasing
- Chunk selector validation for edits now rejects non-canonical selectors (suffix-only like `fn_run` or prefix-stripped like `run`), requiring fully-qualified paths to prevent ambiguity
- Plan review previews now re-append at the chat tail on refresh, keeping them adjacent to the active selector instead of updating off-screen
- `log_experiment` validates and reverts run-scoped file changes without clobbering unrelated dirty worktree state
- Chunk edit targets that embed CRC in the selector (e.g. `fn_foo#ABCD`) parse correctly
- Shell paths check errors before consuming chunk output (bash executor, config resolution)
- `/autoresearch` toggles like `/plan` when empty; slash completion no longer suggests `off`/`clear` on an empty prefix after the command
- Chunk-mode read/edit edge cases (zero-width gap replaces, stale batch diagnostics, grouped Go receivers, line-count headers, parse error locations)

### Added

- `/review` command now accepts inline args as custom instructions appended to the generated prompt for all structured review modes (PR-style, uncommitted, specific commit). When inline args are provided, option 4 (editor) is suppressed from the menu. The no-UI (Task tool) path forwards args as a focus hint.

### Changed

- Changed edit tool response to include diff summary with line counts (+added -removed) and a compact diff preview instead of warnings-only output
- Limited auto context promotion to models with explicit `contextPromotionTarget`; models without a configured target now compact on overflow instead of switching to arbitrary larger models ([#282](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/282))

### Fixed

- Fixed `:thinking` suffix in `modelRoles` config values silently breaking model resolution (e.g., `slow: anthropic/claude-opus-4-6:high`) and being stripped on Ctrl+P role cycling

## [13.7.3] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- Added Kagi Universal Summarizer integration for URL summarization, now prioritized before Jina and other methods
- Added Kagi Universal Summarizer support for YouTube video summaries when credentials are available

## [13.7.0] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- Fixed `ask` timeout handling to auto-select the recommended option instead of aborting the turn, while preserving explicit user-cancel abort behavior ([#266](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/266))

## [13.6.2] - 2026-03-03

- Added post-update verification that checks the resolved `omp` binary reports the expected version, with actionable warnings on mismatch
- `omp update` now detects when the `omp` in PATH is not managed by bun and falls back to binary replacement instead of updating the wrong location

## [13.6.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- Added `mcp://` internal URL protocol for reading MCP server resources directly via the read tool (e.g., `read(path="mcp://resource-uri")`)
- Added LM Studio integration to the model registry and discovery flow.
- Added support for authenticating with LM Studio using the `/login lm-studio` command.
- Added `fuse-projfs` task isolation mode for Windows ProjFS-backed overlays.

- Added OAuth failure fallback in `/mcp registry search` deploy flow to prompt for manual bearer tokens and validate them before saving configuration
- Added Smithery auth support for `/mcp registry search` with cached API key login (`/mcp registry login`, `/mcp registry logout`) and automatic login prompt/retry on auth or rate-limit responses

### Changed

- Updated MCP resource update notifications to recommend using `read(path="mcp://<uri>")` instead of the deprecated `read_resource` tool
- Updated Anthropic Foundry environment variable documentation and CLI help text to the canonical names: `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_FOUNDRY`, `CLAUDE_CODE_CLIENT_CERT`, and `CLAUDE_CODE_CLIENT_KEY`
- Documented Foundry-specific Anthropic runtime configuration (`FOUNDRY_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_FOUNDRY_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS`, `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`) in environment variable reference docs
- `fuse-overlay` task isolation now targets `fuse-overlayfs` on Unix hosts only; on Windows it falls back to `worktree` with a `<system-notification>` suggesting `fuse-projfs`.
- `fuse-projfs` now performs Windows ProjFS preflight checks and falls back to `worktree` when host or repository prerequisites are unavailable.
- Cross-repo patch capture now uses the platform null device (`NUL` on Windows, `/dev/null` elsewhere) for `git diff --no-index`.

### Removed

### Fixed

- Fixed MCP OAuth discovery to honor `Mcp-Auth-Server` metadata and resolve authorization endpoints from the declared auth server, restoring Figma MCP login URLs with `client_id` ([#235](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/235))

### Added

- Auto-include `ast_grep` and `ast_edit` tools when their text-based counterparts (`grep`, `edit`) are requested and the AST tools are enabled
- Enforced tool decision in plan mode—agent now requires calling either `ask` or `exit_plan_mode` when a turn ends without a required tool call
- Auto-correction of escaped tab indentation in edits (enabled by default, controllable via `PI_HASHLINE_AUTOCORRECT_ESCAPED_TABS` environment variable)
- Warning when suspicious Unicode escape placeholder `\uDDDD` is detected in edit content

### Changed

- Updated bash tool description to conditionally show `ast_grep` and `ast_edit` guidance based on tool availability in the session
- Replaced timeout-based cancellation with AbortSignal-based cancellation in the `ask` tool for more reliable user interaction handling
- Updated `ask` tool to distinguish between user-initiated cancellation and timeout-driven auto-selection, with only user cancellation aborting the turn
- Updated hashline documentation to clarify that `\t` in JSON represents a real tab character, not a literal backslash-t sequence

### Fixed

- Fixed race condition in dialog overlay handling where multiple concurrent resolutions could occur
- Cancelling the `ask` tool now aborts the current turn instead of returning a normal cancelled selection, while timeout-driven auto-cancel still returns without aborting

### Added

- Added `resolve` tool to apply or discard pending preview actions with required reasoning
- AST edit now registers pending actions after preview, allowing explicit apply/discard workflow via `resolve` tool
- Custom tools can register pending actions via `pushPendingAction(action)` in `CustomToolAPI`, enabling the `resolve` workflow for custom preview-apply flows
- `deferrable?: boolean` field added to `AgentTool`, `CustomTool`, and `ToolDefinition` interfaces; tools that set it signal they may stage pending actions
- `HIDDEN_TOOLS` and `ResolveTool` exported from `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent` SDK for manual tool composition
- `PendingActionStore` now uses a LIFO stack (`push`/`peek`/`pop`); multiple deferrable tools can stage actions that resolve in reverse order of registration
- Added `gemini`, `codex`, and `synthetic` as supported values for the `providers.webSearch` setting
- `ast_grep` tool now accepts a `patterns` array (replaces single `pattern`); multiple patterns run in one native pass and results are merged before offset/limit
- `ast_edit` tool now accepts an `ops` array of `{ pat, out }` entries (replaces `pattern` + `rewrite`); duplicate patterns are rejected upfront
- AST find output now uses `>>` prefix on match-start lines and pads line numbers; directory-tree grouping with `# dir` / `## └─ file` headers for directory-scoped searches
- AST replace output now renders diff-style (`-before` / `+after`) change previews grouped by directory
- Both AST tools now report `scopePath`, `files`, and per-file match/replacement counts in tool details
- Task item `id` max length raised from 32 to 48 characters
- Anthropic web search provider now uses `buildAnthropicSearchHeaders` (dedicated search header builder separate from inference headers)
- Gemini web search provider: endpoint fallback (daily → sandbox) with retry on 429/5xx
- Gemini web search now injects Antigravity system instruction and aligned request metadata (`requestType`, `userAgent`, `requestId`) for Antigravity credentials
- `buildGeminiRequestTools()` helper for composable Gemini tool configuration (googleSearch, codeExecution, urlContext)
- Web search schema exposes `max_tokens`, `temperature`, and `num_search_results` as tool parameters
- Web search provider fallback: when an explicit provider is unavailable, resolves the auto chain instead of returning empty results

### Changed

- Simplified `resolve` tool output rendering to use inline highlighted format instead of boxed layout
- Updated `resolve` tool to parse source tool name from label using colon separator for cleaner display
- `resolve` tool is now conditionally injected: included only when at least one active tool has `deferrable: true` (previously always included)
- `discoverAndLoadCustomTools` / `loadCustomTools` accept an optional `pendingActionStore` parameter to wire `pushPendingAction` for custom tools
- AST edit tool no longer accepts `preview` parameter; all AST edit calls now return previews by default
- AST edit workflow changed: preview is always shown, then use `resolve` tool to apply or discard changes
- Agent now suggests calling `resolve` tool after AST edit preview with system reminder
- `ast_grep`: `include_meta` parameter removed; metavariable captures are now always included in output
- `ast_edit`: `dry_run` renamed to `preview`; `max_files` removed from schema and capped globally via `$PI_MAX_AST_FILES` (default 1000); `max_replacements` renamed to `limit`
- `ast_grep` and `ast_edit`: parse errors in tool output are now capped at `PARSE_ERRORS_LIMIT` (20); excess errors are summarised as `N / total parse issues` rather than flooding the context
- Updated `ast_grep` and `ast_edit` tool prompt examples to use concise, idiomatic patterns

### Removed

- Removed `normativeRewrite` setting that rewrote tool call arguments to normalized format in session history
- Removed `buildNormativeUpdateInput()` helper and normative patch transformation logic

### Fixed

- `ast_edit` no longer rejects empty `out` values; an empty string now deletes matched nodes
- `ast_edit` no longer trims `pat` and `out` values, preserving intentional whitespace
- `gemini_image` tool: corrected `responseModalities` values from `'Image'`/`'Text'` to uppercase `'IMAGE'`/`'TEXT'` matching the API enum

## [13.3.14] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- Expanded AST tool language support from 7 to all 25 ast-grep tree-sitter languages (Bash, C, C++, C#, CSS, Elixir, Go, Haskell, HCL, HTML, Java, JavaScript, JSON, Kotlin, Lua, Nix, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Solidity, Swift, TSX, TypeScript, YAML)
- AST find now emits all lines of multiline matches with hashline tags (LINE#HASH:content) consistent with read/grep output
- Added AST pattern syntax reference (metavariables, wildcards, variadics) to system prompt
- Added examples and scoping guidance to ast-grep and ast-edit tool prompts
- Added `provider-schema-compatibility.test.ts`: integration test that instantiates every builtin and hidden tool, runs their parameter schemas through `adaptSchemaForStrict`, `sanitizeSchemaForGoogle`, and `prepareSchemaForCCA`, and asserts zero violations against each provider's compatibility rules

### Fixed

- Non-code files (.md, .zip, .bin, .gitignore, etc.) are now silently skipped by AST tools instead of producing misleading parse errors
- Fixed `grep` path wildcard handling so file patterns passed via `path` (for example `schema-review-*.test.ts`) are resolved as glob filters instead of failing path existence checks

## [13.3.11] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- Restored inline rendering for `read` tool image results in assistant transcript components, including streaming and rebuilt session history paths.
- Fixed shell-escaped read paths (for example, pasted `\ `-escaped screenshot filenames) by resolving unescaped fallback candidates before macOS filename normalization variants.

- Added `getLastAssistantMessage()` method to retrieve the most recent assistant message from session state without manual array indexing
- Implemented TTSR resume gate to ensure `prompt()` blocks until TTSR interrupt continuations complete, preventing race conditions between TTSR injections and subsequent prompts
- Added `tools.maxTimeout` setting to enforce a global timeout ceiling across all tool calls

- Changed element text extraction from `.text` property to `.textContent` property for compatibility with linkedom DOM API
- Optimized document link extraction to use regex-based parsing with deduplication and a 20-link limit instead of full DOM traversal

- Removed `strictness` parameter from ast_grep and ast_edit tools
- Removed `fail_on_parse_error` parameter from ast_edit tool (now always false)
- Updated ast_grep and ast_edit prompt guidance to clarify that `path` accepts glob patterns and no longer requires separate glob specification
- Refactored prompt template rendering to use unified `formatPromptContent()` function with phase-aware formatting (pre-render vs post-render)
- Updated `format-prompts.ts` script to use centralized prompt formatting utility instead of inline implementation
- Replaced `column` parameter with `symbol` parameter for more intuitive position specification
- Removed `files` parameter; use glob patterns in `file` parameter instead

- Removed `column`, `end_line`, and `end_character` parameters in favor of symbol-based positioning
- Removed `include_declaration` parameter from references action

### Fixed

- Fixed TTSR violations during subagent execution aborting the entire subagent run; `#waitForPostPromptRecovery()` now also awaits agent idle after TTSR/retry gates resolve, preventing `prompt()` from returning while a fire-and-forget `agent.continue()` is still streaming
- Fixed deferred TTSR/context-promotion continuations still racing `prompt()` completion by tracking compaction checks and deferred `agent.continue()` tasks under a shared post-prompt recovery orchestrator

- Fixed `references`/`rename`/`hover` symbol targeting to error when `symbol` is missing on the line or `occurrence` is out of bounds
- Fixed `reload` without a file to reload all active configured language servers instead of only the first server
- Fixed `todo_write` task normalization to auto-activate the first remaining task and include explicit remaining-items output in tool results, removing the need for an immediate follow-up start update

## [13.3.7] - 2026-02-27

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `preloadedSkills` option from `CreateAgentSessionOptions`; skills are no longer inlined into system prompts

- Fixed strict schema generation for output schemas with only required fields, enabling proper Claude API compatibility
- Fixed handling of union type schemas (e.g., object|null) to normalize them into strict-mode compatible variants

## [13.3.6] - 2026-02-26

### Breaking Changes

### Added

- Added `PERPLEXITY_COOKIES` env var for Perplexity web search via session cookies extracted from desktop app
- Added `fuse-overlay` isolation mode for subagents using `fuse-overlayfs` (copy-on-write overlay, no baseline patch apply needed)
- Added `task.isolation.merge` setting (`patch` or `branch`) to control how isolated task changes are integrated back. `branch` mode commits each task to a temp branch and cherry-picks for clean commit history
- Added `task.isolation.commits` setting (`generic` or `ai`) for commit messages on isolated task branches and nested repos. `ai` mode uses a smol model to generate conventional commit messages from diffs
- Nested non-submodule git repos are now discovered and handled during task isolation (changes captured and applied independently from parent repo)
- Added `task.eager` setting to encourage the agent to delegate work to subagents by default
- Added manual OAuth login flow that lets users paste redirect URLs with /login for callback-server providers and prevents overlapping logins

### Fixed

- Fixed nested repo changes being lost when tasks commit inside the isolation (baseline state is now committed before task runs, so delta correctly excludes it)
- Fixed nested repo patches conflicting when multiple tasks contribute to the same repo (baseline untracked files no longer leak into patches)
- Nested repo changes are now committed after patch application (previously left as untracked files)
- Failed tasks no longer create stale branches or capture garbage patches (gated on exit code)
- Merge failures (e.g. conflicting patches) are now non-fatal — agent output is preserved with `merge failed` status instead of `failed`
- Stale branches are cleaned up when `commitToBranch` fails
- Commit message generator filters lock files from diffs before AI summarization

- LSP diagnostics on edit: Edit tool can now return LSP diagnostics after editing code files. Disabled by default to avoid noise during multi-edit sequences. Enable via `lsp.diagnosticsOnEdit` setting.
- LSP workspace diagnostics: New `lsp action=workspace_diagnostics` command checks the entire project for errors. Auto-detects project type and uses appropriate checker (rust-analyzer/cargo for Rust, tsc for TypeScript, go build for Go, pyright for Python).
- LSP local binary resolution: LSP servers installed in project-local directories are now discovered automatically. Checks `node_modules/.bin/` for Node.js projects, `.venv/bin/`/`venv/bin/` for Python projects, and `vendor/bundle/bin/` for Ruby projects before falling back to `$PATH`.
- LSP format on write: Write tool now automatically formats code files using LSP after writing. Uses the language server's built-in formatter (e.g., rustfmt for Rust, gofmt for Go). Controlled via `lsp.formatOnWrite` setting (enabled by default).
- LSP diagnostics on write: Write tool now returns LSP diagnostics (errors/warnings) after writing code files. This gives immediate feedback on syntax errors and type issues. Controlled via `lsp.diagnosticsOnWrite` setting (enabled by default).
- LSP server warmup at startup: LSP servers are now started at launch to avoid cold-start delays when first writing files.
- LSP server status in welcome banner: Shows which language servers are active and ready.

- Comprehensive LSP server configurations for 40+ languages including Rust, Go, Python, Java, Kotlin, Scala, Haskell, OCaml, Elixir, Ruby, PHP, C#, Lua, Nix, and many more. Each server includes sensible defaults for args, settings, and init options.
- Extended LSP config file search paths: Now searches for `lsp.json`, `.lsp.json` in project root and `.omp/` subdirectory, plus user-level configs in `~/.omp/` and home directory.

### Changed

- LSP settings moved to dedicated "LSP" tab in `/settings` for better organization
- Improved grep tool description to document pagination options (`headLimit`, `offset`) and clarify recursive search behavior
- LSP idle timeout now disabled by default. Configure via `idleTimeoutMs` in lsp.json to auto-shutdown inactive servers.
- Model settings now use role-based storage (`modelRoles` map) instead of single `defaultProvider`/`defaultModel` fields. Supports multiple model roles (default, small, etc.)
- Session model persistence now uses `"provider/modelId"` string format with optional role field

### Fixed

- Recent sessions now show in welcome banner (was never wired up).
- Auto-generated session titles: Sessions are now automatically titled based on the first message using a small model (Haiku/GPT-4o-mini/Flash).

- Model selector no longer allows negative index when pressing arrow keys before models finish loading ([#398](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/398) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))
- Type guard functions (`isBashToolResult`, etc.) now exported at runtime, not just in type declarations ([#397](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/397))

## [0.31.0] - 2026-01-02

This release introduces session trees for in-place branching, major API changes to hooks and custom tools, and structured compaction with file tracking.

### Session Tree

Sessions now use a tree structure with `id`/`parentId` fields. This enables in-place branching: navigate to any previous point with `/tree`, continue from there, and switch between branches while preserving all history in a single file.

**Existing sessions are automatically migrated** (v1 → v2) on first load. No manual action required.

New entry types: `BranchSummaryEntry` (context from abandoned branches), `CustomEntry` (hook state), `CustomMessageEntry` (hook-injected messages), `LabelEntry` (bookmarks).

See [docs/session.md](docs/session.md) for the file format and `SessionManager` API.

### Hooks Migration

The hooks API has been restructured with more granular events and better session access.

**Type renames:**

- `HookEventContext` → `HookContext`
- `HookCommandContext` is now a new interface extending `HookContext` with session control methods

**Event changes:**

- The monolithic `session` event is now split into granular events: `session_start`, `session_before_switch`, `session_switch`, `session_before_branch`, `session_branch`, `session_before_compact`, `session_compact`, `session_shutdown`
- `session_before_switch` and `session_switch` events now include `reason: "new" | "resume"` to distinguish between `/new` and `/resume`
- New `session_before_tree` and `session_tree` events for `/tree` navigation (hook can provide custom branch summary)
- New `before_agent_start` event: inject messages before the agent loop starts
- New `context` event: modify messages non-destructively before each LLM call
- Session entries are no longer passed in events. Use `ctx.sessionManager.getEntries()` or `ctx.sessionManager.getBranch()` instead

**API changes:**

- `pi.send(text, attachments?)` → `pi.sendMessage(message, triggerTurn?)` (creates `CustomMessageEntry`)
- New `pi.appendEntry(customType, data?)` for hook state persistence (not in LLM context)
- New `pi.registerCommand(name, options)` for custom slash commands (handler receives `HookCommandContext`)
- New `pi.registerMessageRenderer(customType, renderer)` for custom TUI rendering
- New `ctx.isIdle()`, `ctx.abort()`, `ctx.hasQueuedMessages()` for agent state (available in all events)
- New `ctx.ui.editor(title, prefill?)` for multi-line text editing with Ctrl+G external editor support
- New `ctx.ui.custom(component)` for full TUI component rendering with keyboard focus
- New `ctx.ui.setStatus(key, text)` for persistent status text in footer (multiple hooks can set their own)
- New `ctx.ui.theme` getter for styling text with theme colors
- `ctx.exec()` moved to `pi.exec()`
- `ctx.sessionFile` → `ctx.sessionManager.getSessionFile()`
- New `ctx.modelRegistry` and `ctx.model` for API key resolution

**HookCommandContext (slash commands only):**

- `ctx.waitForIdle()` - wait for agent to finish streaming
- `ctx.newSession(options?)` - create new sessions with optional setup callback
- `ctx.branch(entryId)` - branch from a specific entry
- `ctx.navigateTree(targetId, options?)` - navigate the session tree

These methods are only on `HookCommandContext` (not `HookContext`) because they can deadlock if called from event handlers that run inside the agent loop.

**Removed:**

- `hookTimeout` setting (hooks no longer have timeouts; use Ctrl+C to abort)
- `resolveApiKey` parameter (use `ctx.modelRegistry.getApiKey(model)`)

See [docs/hooks.md](docs/hooks.md) and [examples/hooks/](examples/hooks/) for the current API.

### Custom Tools Migration

The custom tools API has been restructured to mirror the hooks pattern with a context object.

**Type renames:**

- `CustomAgentTool` → `CustomTool`
- `ToolAPI` → `CustomToolAPI`
- `ToolContext` → `CustomToolContext`
- `ToolSessionEvent` → `CustomToolSessionEvent`

**Execute signature changed:**

```typescript
// Before (v0.30.2)
execute(toolCallId, params, signal, onUpdate)

// After
execute(toolCallId, params, onUpdate, ctx, signal?)
```

The new `ctx: CustomToolContext` provides `sessionManager`, `modelRegistry`, `model`, and agent state methods:

- `ctx.isIdle()` - check if agent is streaming
- `ctx.hasQueuedMessages()` - check if user has queued messages (skip interactive prompts)
- `ctx.abort()` - abort current operation (fire-and-forget)

**Session event changes:**

- `CustomToolSessionEvent` now only has `reason` and `previousSessionFile`
- Session entries are no longer in the event. Use `ctx.sessionManager.getBranch()` or `ctx.sessionManager.getEntries()` to reconstruct state
- Reasons: `"start" | "switch" | "branch" | "tree" | "shutdown"` (no separate `"new"` reason; `/new` triggers `"switch"`)
- `dispose()` method removed. Use `onSession` with `reason: "shutdown"` for cleanup

See [docs/custom-tools.md](docs/custom-tools.md) and [examples/custom-tools/](examples/custom-tools/) for the current API.

### SDK Migration

**Type changes:**

- `CustomAgentTool` → `CustomTool`
- `AppMessage` → `AgentMessage`
- `sessionFile` returns `string | undefined` (was `string | null`)
- `model` returns `Model | undefined` (was `Model | null`)
- `Attachment` type removed. Use `ImageContent` from `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai` instead. Add images directly to message content arrays.

**AgentSession API:**

- `branch(entryIndex: number)` → `branch(entryId: string)`
- `getUserMessagesForBranching()` returns `{ entryId, text }` instead of `{ entryIndex, text }`
- `reset()` → `newSession(options?)` where options has optional `parentSession` for lineage tracking
- `newSession()` and `switchSession()` now return `Promise<boolean>` (false if cancelled by hook)
- New `navigateTree(targetId, options?)` for in-place tree navigation

**Hook integration:**

- New `sendHookMessage(message, triggerTurn?)` for hook message injection

**SessionManager API:**

- Method renames: `saveXXX()` → `appendXXX()` (e.g., `appendMessage`, `appendCompaction`)
- `branchInPlace()` → `branch()`
- `reset()` → `newSession(options?)` with optional `parentSession` for lineage tracking
- `createBranchedSessionFromEntries(entries, index)` → `createBranchedSession(leafId)`
- `SessionHeader.branchedFrom` → `SessionHeader.parentSession`
- `saveCompaction(entry)` → `appendCompaction(summary, firstKeptEntryId, tokensBefore, details?)`
- `getEntries()` now excludes the session header (use `getHeader()` separately)
- `getSessionFile()` returns `string | undefined` (undefined for in-memory sessions)
- New tree methods: `getTree()`, `getBranch()`, `getLeafId()`, `getLeafEntry()`, `getEntry()`, `getChildren()`, `getLabel()`
- New append methods: `appendCustomEntry()`, `appendCustomMessageEntry()`, `appendLabelChange()`
- New branch methods: `branch(entryId)`, `branchWithSummary()`

**ModelRegistry (new):**

`ModelRegistry` is a new class that manages model discovery and API key resolution. It combines built-in models with custom models from `models.json` and resolves API keys via `AuthStorage`.

```typescript
import { discoverAuthStorage, discoverModels } from "@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent";

const authStorage = discoverAuthStorage(); // ~/.omp/agent/auth.json
const modelRegistry = discoverModels(authStorage); // + ~/.omp/agent/models.json

// Get all models (built-in + custom)
const allModels = modelRegistry.getAll();

// Get only models with valid API keys
const available = await modelRegistry.getAvailable();

// Find specific model
const model = modelRegistry.find("anthropic", "claude-sonnet-4-20250514");

// Get API key for a model
const apiKey = await modelRegistry.getApiKey(model);
```

This replaces the old `resolveApiKey` callback pattern. Hooks and custom tools access it via `ctx.modelRegistry`.

**Renamed exports:**

- `messageTransformer` → `convertToLlm`
- `SessionContext` alias `LoadedSession` removed

See [docs/sdk.md](docs/sdk.md) and [examples/sdk/](examples/sdk/) for the current API.

### RPC Migration

**Session commands:**

- `reset` command → `new_session` command with optional `parentSession` field

**Branching commands:**

- `branch` command: `entryIndex` → `entryId`
- `get_branch_messages` response: `entryIndex` → `entryId`

**Type changes:**

- Messages are now `AgentMessage` (was `AppMessage`)
- `prompt` command: `attachments` field replaced with `images` field using `ImageContent` format

**Compaction events:**

- `auto_compaction_start` now includes `reason` field (`"threshold"` or `"overflow"`)
- `auto_compaction_end` now includes `willRetry` field
- `compact` response includes full `CompactionResult` (`summary`, `firstKeptEntryId`, `tokensBefore`, `details`)

See [docs/rpc.md](docs/rpc.md) for the current protocol.

### Structured Compaction

Compaction and branch summarization now use a structured output format:

- Clear sections: Goal, Progress, Key Information, File Operations
- File tracking: `readFiles` and `modifiedFiles` arrays in `details`, accumulated across compactions
- Conversations are serialized to text before summarization to prevent the model from "continuing" them

The `before_compact` and `before_tree` hook events allow custom compaction implementations. See [docs/compaction.md](docs/compaction.md).

### Interactive Mode

**`/tree` command:**

- Navigate the full session tree in-place
- Search by typing, page with ←/→
- Filter modes (Ctrl+O): default → no-tools → user-only → labeled-only → all
- Press `l` to label entries as bookmarks
- Selecting a branch switches context and optionally injects a summary of the abandoned branch

**Entry labels:**

- Bookmark any entry via `/tree` → select → `l`
- Labels appear in tree view and persist as `LabelEntry`

**Theme changes (breaking for custom themes):**

Custom themes must add these new color tokens or they will fail to load:

- `selectedBg`: background for selected/highlighted items in tree selector and other components
- `customMessageBg`: background for hook-injected messages (`CustomMessageEntry`)
- `customMessageText`: text color for hook messages
- `customMessageLabel`: label color for hook messages (the `[customType]` prefix)

Total color count increased from 46 to 50. See [docs/theme.md](docs/theme.md) for the full color list and copy values from the built-in dark/light themes.

**Settings:**

- `enabledModels`: allowlist models in `settings.json` (same format as `--models` CLI)

### Added

- `ctx.ui.setStatus(key, text)` for hooks to display persistent status text in the footer ([#385](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/385) by [@prateekmedia](https://github.com/prateekmedia))
- `ctx.ui.theme` getter for styling status text and other output with theme colors
- `/share` command to upload session as a secret GitHub gist and get a shareable URL via shittycodingagent.ai ([#380](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/380))
- HTML export now includes a tree visualization sidebar for navigating session branches ([#375](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/375))
- HTML export supports keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+T to toggle thinking blocks, Ctrl+O to toggle tool outputs
- HTML export supports theme-configurable background colors via optional `export` section in theme JSON ([#387](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/387) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))
- HTML export syntax highlighting now uses theme colors and matches TUI rendering
- **Snake game example hook**: Demonstrates `ui.custom()`, `registerCommand()`, and session persistence. See [examples/hooks/snake.ts](examples/hooks/snake.ts).
- **`thinkingText` theme token**: Configurable color for thinking block text. ([#366](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/366) by [@paulbettner](https://github.com/paulbettner))

### Changed

- **Entry IDs**: Session entries now use short 8-character hex IDs instead of full UUIDs
- **API key priority**: `ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN` now takes precedence over `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- HTML export template split into separate files (template.html, template.css, template.js) for easier maintenance

### Fixed

- HTML export now properly sanitizes user messages containing HTML tags like `<style>` that could break DOM rendering
- Crash when displaying bash output containing Unicode format characters like U+0600-U+0604 ([#372](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/372) by [@HACKE-RC](https://github.com/HACKE-RC))
- **Footer shows full session stats**: Token usage and cost now include all messages, not just those after compaction. ([#322](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/322))
- **Status messages spam chat log**: Rapidly changing settings (e.g., thinking level via Shift+Tab) would add multiple status lines. Sequential status updates now coalesce into a single line. ([#365](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/365) by [@paulbettner](https://github.com/paulbettner))
- **Toggling thinking blocks during streaming shows nothing**: Pressing Ctrl+T while streaming would hide the current message until streaming completed.
- **Resuming session resets thinking level to off**: Initial model and thinking level were not saved to session file, causing `--resume`/`--continue` to default to `off`. ([#342](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/342) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))
- **Hook `tool_result` event ignores errors from custom tools**: The `tool_result` hook event was never emitted when tools threw errors, and always had `isError: false` for successful executions. Now emits the event with correct `isError` value in both success and error cases. ([#374](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/374) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))
- **Edit tool fails on Windows due to CRLF line endings**: Files with CRLF line endings now match correctly when LLMs send LF-only text. Line endings are normalized before matching and restored to original style on write. ([#355](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/355) by [@Pratham-Dubey](https://github.com/Pratham-Dubey))
- **Edit tool fails on files with UTF-8 BOM**: Files with UTF-8 BOM marker could cause "text not found" errors since the LLM doesn't include the invisible BOM character. BOM is now stripped before matching and restored on write. ([#394](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/394) by [@prathamdby](https://github.com/prathamdby))
- **Use bash instead of sh on Unix**: Fixed shell commands using `/bin/sh` instead of `/bin/bash` on Unix systems. ([#328](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/328) by [@dnouri](https://github.com/dnouri))
- **OAuth login URL clickable**: Made OAuth login URLs clickable in terminal. ([#349](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/349) by [@Cursivez](https://github.com/Cursivez))
- **Improved error messages**: Better error messages when `apiKey` or `model` are missing. ([#346](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/346) by [@ronyrus](https://github.com/ronyrus))
- **Session file validation**: `findMostRecentSession()` now validates session headers before returning, preventing non-session JSONL files from being loaded
- **Compaction error handling**: `generateSummary()` and `generateTurnPrefixSummary()` now throw on LLM errors instead of returning empty strings
- **Compaction with branched sessions**: Fixed compaction incorrectly including entries from abandoned branches, causing token overflow errors. Compaction now uses `sessionManager.getPath()` to work only on the current branch path, eliminating 80+ lines of duplicate entry collection logic between `prepareCompaction()` and `compact()`
- **enabledModels glob patterns**: `--models` and `enabledModels` now support glob patterns like `github-copilot/*` or `*sonnet*`. Previously, patterns were only matched literally or via substring search. ([#337](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/337))

## [0.30.2] - 2025-12-26

### Changed

- **Consolidated migrations**: Moved auth migration from `AuthStorage.migrateLegacy()` to new `migrations.ts` module.

## [0.30.1] - 2025-12-26

### Fixed

- **Sessions saved to wrong directory**: In v0.30.0, sessions were being saved to `~/.omp/agent/` instead of `~/.omp/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/`, breaking `--resume` and `/resume`. Misplaced sessions are automatically migrated on startup. ([#320](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/320) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))
- **Custom system prompts missing context**: When using a custom system prompt string, project context files (AGENTS.md), skills, date/time, and working directory were not appended. ([#321](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/321))

## [0.30.0] - 2025-12-25

### Breaking Changes

- **SessionManager API**: The second parameter of `create()`, `continueRecent()`, and `list()` changed from `agentDir` to `sessionDir`. When provided, it specifies the session directory directly (no cwd encoding). When omitted, uses default (`~/.omp/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/`). `open()` no longer takes `agentDir`. ([#313](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/313))

### Added

- **`--session-dir` flag**: Use a custom directory for sessions instead of the default `~/.omp/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/`. Works with `-c` (continue) and `-r` (resume) flags. ([#313](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/313) by [@scutifer](https://github.com/scutifer))
- **Reverse model cycling and model selector**: Shift+Ctrl+P cycles models backward, Ctrl+L opens model selector (retaining text in editor). ([#315](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/315) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))

## [0.29.1] - 2025-12-25

### Added

- **Automatic custom system prompt loading**: OMP now auto-loads `SYSTEM.md` files to replace the default system prompt. Project-local `.omp/SYSTEM.md` takes precedence over global `~/.omp/agent/SYSTEM.md`. CLI `--system-prompt` flag overrides both. ([#309](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/309))
- **Unified `/settings` command**: New settings menu consolidating thinking level, theme, queue mode, auto-compact, show images, hide thinking, and collapse changelog. Replaces individual `/thinking`, `/queue`, `/theme`, `/autocompact`, and `/show-images` commands. ([#310](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/310))

### Fixed

- **Custom tools/hooks with typebox subpath imports**: Fixed jiti alias for `@sinclair/typebox` to point to package root instead of entry file, allowing imports like `@sinclair/typebox/compiler` to resolve correctly. ([#311](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/311) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

## [0.29.0] - 2025-12-25

### Breaking Changes

- **Renamed `/clear` to `/new`**: The command to start a fresh session is now `/new`. Hook event reasons `before_clear`/`clear` are now `before_new`/`new`. Merry Christmas [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko)! ([#305](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/305))

### Added

- **Auto-space before pasted file paths**: When pasting a file path (starting with `/`, `~`, or `.`) after a word character, a space is automatically prepended. ([#307](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/307) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))
- **Word navigation in input fields**: Added Ctrl+Left/Right and Alt+Left/Right for word-by-word cursor movement. ([#306](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/306) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))
- **Full Unicode input**: Input fields now accept Unicode characters beyond ASCII. ([#306](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/306) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

### Fixed

- **Readline-style Ctrl+W**: Now skips trailing whitespace before deleting the preceding word, matching standard readline behavior. ([#306](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/306) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

## [0.28.0] - 2025-12-25

### Changed

- **Credential storage refactored**: API keys and OAuth tokens are now stored in `~/.omp/agent/auth.json` instead of `oauth.json` and `settings.json`. Existing credentials are automatically migrated on first run. ([#296](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/296))

- **SDK API changes** ([#296](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/296)):
  - Added `AuthStorage` class for credential management (API keys and OAuth tokens)
  - Added `ModelRegistry` class for model discovery and API key resolution
  - Added `discoverAuthStorage()` and `discoverModels()` discovery functions
  - `createAgentSession()` now accepts `authStorage` and `modelRegistry` options
  - Removed `configureOAuthStorage()`, `defaultGetApiKey()`, `findModel()`, `discoverAvailableModels()`
  - Removed `getApiKey` callback option (use `AuthStorage.setRuntimeApiKey()` for runtime overrides)
  - Use `getModel()` from `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai` for built-in models, `modelRegistry.find()` for custom models + built-in models
  - See updated [SDK documentation](docs/sdk.md) and [README](README.md)

- **Settings changes**: Removed `apiKeys` from `settings.json`. Use `auth.json` instead. ([#296](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/296))

### Fixed

- **Duplicate skill warnings for symlinks**: Skills loaded via symlinks pointing to the same file are now silently deduplicated instead of showing name collision warnings. ([#304](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/304) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))

## [0.27.9] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed

- **Model selector and --list-models with settings.json API keys**: Models with API keys configured in settings.json (but not in environment variables) now properly appear in the /model selector and `--list-models` output. ([#295](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/295))

## [0.27.8] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed

- **API key priority**: OAuth tokens now take priority over settings.json API keys. Previously, an API key in settings.json would trump OAuth, causing users logged in with a plan (unlimited tokens) to be billed via PAYG instead.

## [0.27.7] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed

- **Thinking tag leakage**: Fixed Claude mimicking literal `</thinking>` tags in responses. Unsigned thinking blocks (from aborted streams) are now converted to plain text without `<thinking>` tags. The TUI still displays them as thinking blocks. ([#302](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/302) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

## [0.27.6] - 2025-12-24

### Added

- **Compaction hook improvements**: The `before_compact` session event now includes:
  - `previousSummary`: Summary from the last compaction (if any), so hooks can preserve accumulated context
  - `messagesToKeep`: Messages that will be kept after the summary (recent turns), in addition to `messagesToSummarize`
  - `resolveApiKey`: Function to resolve API keys for any model (checks settings, OAuth, env vars)
  - Removed `apiKey` string in favor of `resolveApiKey` for more flexibility

- **SessionManager API cleanup**:
  - Renamed `loadSessionFromEntries()` to `buildSessionContext()` (builds LLM context from entries, handling compaction)
  - Renamed `loadEntries()` to `getEntries()` (returns defensive copy of all session entries)
  - Added `buildSessionContext()` method to SessionManager

## [0.27.5] - 2025-12-24

### Added

- **HTML export syntax highlighting**: Code blocks in markdown and tool outputs (read, write) now have syntax highlighting using highlight.js with theme-aware colors matching the TUI.
- **HTML export improvements**: Render markdown server-side using marked (tables, headings, code blocks, etc.), honor user's chosen theme (light/dark), add image rendering for user messages, and style code blocks with TUI-like language markers. ([@scutifer](https://github.com/scutifer))

### Fixed

- **Ghostty inline images in tmux**: Fixed terminal detection for Ghostty when running inside tmux by checking `GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR` env var. ([#299](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/299) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

## [0.27.4] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed

- **Symlinked skill directories**: Skills in symlinked directories (e.g., `~/.omp/agent/skills/my-skills -> /path/to/skills`) are now correctly discovered and loaded.

## [0.27.3] - 2025-12-24

### Added

- **API keys in settings.json**: Store API keys in `~/.omp/agent/settings.json` under the `apiKeys` field (e.g., `{ "apiKeys": { "anthropic": "sk-..." } }`). Settings keys take priority over environment variables. ([#295](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/295))

### Fixed

- **Allow startup without API keys**: Interactive mode no longer throws when no API keys are configured. Users can now start the agent and use `/login` to authenticate. ([#288](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/288))
- **`--system-prompt` file path support**: The `--system-prompt` argument now correctly resolves file paths (like `--append-system-prompt` already did). ([#287](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/287) by [@scutifer](https://github.com/scutifer))

## [0.27.2] - 2025-12-23

### Added

- **Skip conversation restore on branch**: Hooks can return `{ skipConversationRestore: true }` from `before_branch` to create the branched session file without restoring conversation messages. Useful for checkpoint hooks that restore files separately. ([#286](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/286) by [@nicobarray](https://github.com/nicobarray))

## [0.27.1] - 2025-12-22

### Fixed

- **Skill discovery performance**: Skip `node_modules` directories when recursively scanning for skills. Fixes ~60ms startup delay when skill directories contain npm dependencies.

### Added

- **Startup timing instrumentation**: Set `OMP_TIMING=1` to see startup performance breakdown (interactive mode only).

## [0.27.0] - 2025-12-22

### Breaking

- **Session hooks API redesign**: Merged `branch` event into `session` event. `BranchEvent`, `BranchEventResult` types and `pi.on("branch", ...)` removed. Use `pi.on("session", ...)` with `reason: "before_branch" | "branch"` instead. `AgentSession.branch()` returns `{ cancelled }` instead of `{ skipped }`. `AgentSession.reset()` and `switchSession()` now return `boolean` (false if cancelled by hook). RPC commands `reset`, `switch_session`, and `branch` now include `cancelled` in response data. ([#278](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/278))

### Added

- **Session lifecycle hooks**: Added `before_*` variants (`before_switch`, `before_clear`, `before_branch`) that fire before actions and can be cancelled with `{ cancel: true }`. Added `shutdown` reason for graceful exit handling. ([#278](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/278))

### Fixed

- **File tab completion display**: File paths no longer get cut off early. Folders now show trailing `/` and removed redundant "directory"/"file" labels to maximize horizontal space. ([#280](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/280))

- **Bash tool visual line truncation**: Fixed bash tool output in collapsed mode to use visual line counting (accounting for line wrapping) instead of logical line counting. Now consistent with bash-execution.ts behavior. Extracted shared `truncateToVisualLines` utility. ([#275](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/275))

## [0.26.1] - 2025-12-22

### Fixed

- **SDK tools respect cwd**: Core tools (bash, read, edit, write, grep, find, ls) now properly use the `cwd` option from `createAgentSession()`. Added tool factory functions (`createBashTool`, `createReadTool`, etc.) for SDK users who specify custom `cwd` with explicit tools. ([#279](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/279))

## [0.26.0] - 2025-12-22

### Added

- **SDK for programmatic usage**: New `createAgentSession()` factory with full control over model, tools, hooks, skills, session persistence, and settings. Philosophy: "omit to discover, provide to override". Includes 12 examples and comprehensive documentation. ([#272](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/272))

- **Project-specific settings**: Settings now load from both `~/.omp/agent/settings.json` (global) and `<cwd>/.omp/settings.json` (project). Project settings override global with deep merge for nested objects. Project settings are read-only (for version control). ([#276](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/276))

- **SettingsManager static factories**: `SettingsManager.create(cwd?, agentDir?)` for file-based settings, `SettingsManager.inMemory(settings?)` for testing. Added `applyOverrides()` for programmatic overrides.

- **SessionManager static factories**: `SessionManager.create()`, `SessionManager.open()`, `SessionManager.continueRecent()`, `SessionManager.inMemory()`, `SessionManager.list()` for flexible session management.

## [0.25.4] - 2025-12-22

### Fixed

- **Syntax highlighting stderr spam**: Fixed cli-highlight logging errors to stderr when markdown contains malformed code fences (e.g., missing newlines around closing backticks). Now validates language identifiers before highlighting and falls back silently to plain text. ([#274](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/274))

## [0.25.3] - 2025-12-21

### Added

- **Gemini 3 preview models**: Added `gemini-3-pro-preview` and `gemini-3-flash-preview` to the google-gemini-cli provider. ([#264](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/264) by [@LukeFost](https://github.com/LukeFost))

- **External editor support**: Press `Ctrl+G` to edit your message in an external editor. Uses `$VISUAL` or `$EDITOR` environment variable. On successful save, the message is replaced; on cancel, the original is kept. ([#266](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/266) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))

- **Process suspension**: Press `Ctrl+Z` to suspend omp and return to the shell. Resume with `fg` as usual. ([#267](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/267) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))

- **Configurable skills directories**: Added granular control over skill sources with `enableCodexUser`, `enableClaudeUser`, `enableClaudeProject`, `enablePiUser`, `enablePiProject` toggles, plus `customDirectories` and `ignoredSkills` settings. ([#269](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/269) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

- **Skills CLI filtering**: Added `--skills <patterns>` flag for filtering skills with glob patterns. Also added `includeSkills` setting and glob pattern support for `ignoredSkills`. ([#268](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/268))

## [0.25.2] - 2025-12-21

### Fixed

- **Image shifting in tool output**: Fixed an issue where images in tool output would shift down (due to accumulating spacers) each time the tool output was expanded or collapsed via Ctrl+O.

## [0.25.1] - 2025-12-21

### Fixed

- **Gemini image reading broken**: Fixed the `read` tool returning images causing flaky/broken responses with Gemini models. Images in tool results are now properly formatted per the Gemini API spec.

- **Tab completion for absolute paths**: Fixed tab completion producing `//tmp` instead of `/tmp/`. Also fixed symlinks to directories (like `/tmp`) not getting a trailing slash, which prevented continuing to tab through subdirectories.

## [0.25.0] - 2025-12-20

### Added

- **Interruptible tool execution**: Queuing a message while tools are executing now interrupts the current tool batch. Remaining tools are skipped with an error result, and your queued message is processed immediately. Useful for redirecting the agent mid-task. ([#259](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/259) by [@steipete](https://github.com/steipete))

- **Google Gemini CLI OAuth provider**: Access Gemini 2.0/2.5 models for free via Google Cloud Code Assist. Login with `/login` and select "Google Gemini CLI". Uses your Google account with rate limits.

- **Google Antigravity OAuth provider**: Access Gemini 3, Claude (sonnet/opus thinking models), and GPT-OSS models for free via Google's Antigravity sandbox. Login with `/login` and select "Antigravity". Uses your Google account with rate limits.

### Changed

- **Model selector respects --models scope**: The `/model` command now only shows models specified via `--models` flag when that flag is used, instead of showing all available models. This prevents accidentally selecting models from unintended providers. ([#255](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/255))

### Fixed

- **Connection errors not retried**: Added "connection error" to the list of retryable errors so Anthropic connection drops trigger auto-retry instead of silently failing. ([#252](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/252))

- **Thinking level not clamped on model switch**: Fixed TUI showing xhigh thinking level after switching to a model that doesn't support it. Thinking level is now automatically clamped to model capabilities. ([#253](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/253))

- **Cross-model thinking handoff**: Fixed error when switching between models with different thinking signature formats (e.g., GPT-OSS to Claude thinking models via Antigravity). Thinking blocks without signatures are now converted to text with `<thinking>` delimiters.

## [0.24.5] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed

- **Input buffering in iTerm2**: Fixed Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D, and other keys requiring multiple presses in iTerm2. The cell size query response parser was incorrectly holding back keyboard input.

## [0.24.4] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed

- **Arrow keys and Enter in selector components**: Fixed arrow keys and Enter not working in model selector, session selector, OAuth selector, and other selector components when Caps Lock or Num Lock is enabled. ([#243](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/243))

## [0.24.3] - 2025-12-19

### Fixed

- **Footer overflow on narrow terminals**: Fixed footer path display exceeding terminal width when resizing to very narrow widths, causing rendering crashes. /arminsayshi

## [0.24.2] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed

- **More Kitty keyboard protocol fixes**: Fixed Backspace, Enter, Home, End, and Delete keys not working with Caps Lock enabled. The initial fix in 0.24.1 missed several key handlers that were still using raw byte detection. Now all key handlers use the helper functions that properly mask out lock key bits. ([#243](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/243))

## [0.24.1] - 2025-12-19

### Added

- **OAuth and model config exports**: Scripts using `AgentSession` directly can now import `getAvailableModels`, `getApiKeyForModel`, `findModel`, `login`, `logout`, and `getOAuthProviders` from `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent` to reuse OAuth token storage and model resolution. ([#245](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/245))

- **xhigh thinking level for gpt-5.2 models**: The thinking level selector and shift+tab cycling now show xhigh option for gpt-5.2 and gpt-5.2-codex models (in addition to gpt-5.1-codex-max). ([#236](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/236) by [@theBucky](https://github.com/theBucky))

### Fixed

- **Hooks wrap custom tools**: Custom tools are now executed through the hook wrapper, so `tool_call`/`tool_result` hooks can observe, block, and modify custom tool executions (consistent with hook type docs). ([#248](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/248) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

- **Hook onUpdate callback forwarding**: The `onUpdate` callback is now correctly forwarded through the hook wrapper, fixing custom tool progress updates. ([#238](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/238) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

- **Terminal cleanup on Ctrl+C in session selector**: Fixed terminal not being properly restored when pressing Ctrl+C in the session selector. ([#247](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/247) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))

- **OpenRouter models with colons in IDs**: Fixed parsing of OpenRouter model IDs that contain colons (e.g., `openrouter:meta-llama/llama-4-scout:free`). ([#242](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/242) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))

- **Global AGENTS.md loaded twice**: Fixed global AGENTS.md being loaded twice when present in both `~/.omp/agent/` and the current directory. ([#239](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/239) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))

- **Kitty keyboard protocol on Linux**: Fixed keyboard input not working in Ghostty on Linux when Num Lock is enabled. The Kitty protocol includes Caps Lock and Num Lock state in modifier values, which broke key detection. Now correctly masks out lock key bits when matching keyboard shortcuts. ([#243](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/243))

- **Emoji deletion and cursor movement**: Backspace, Delete, and arrow keys now correctly handle multi-codepoint characters like emojis. Previously, deleting an emoji would leave partial bytes, corrupting the editor state. ([#240](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/240))

## [0.24.0] - 2025-12-19

### Added

- **Subagent orchestration example**: Added comprehensive custom tool example for spawning and orchestrating sub-agents with isolated context windows. Includes scout/planner/reviewer/worker agents and workflow commands for multi-agent pipelines. ([#215](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/215) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

- **`getMarkdownTheme()` export**: Custom tools can now import `getMarkdownTheme()` from `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent` to use the same markdown styling as the main UI.

- **`pi.exec()` signal and timeout support**: Custom tools and hooks can now pass `{ signal, timeout }` options to `pi.exec()` for cancellation and timeout handling. The result includes a `killed` flag when the process was terminated.

- **Kitty keyboard protocol support**: Shift+Enter, Alt+Enter, Shift+Tab, Ctrl+D, and all Ctrl+key combinations now work in Ghostty, Kitty, WezTerm, and other modern terminals. ([#225](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/225) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

- **Dynamic API key refresh**: OAuth tokens (GitHub Copilot, Anthropic OAuth) are now refreshed before each LLM call, preventing failures in long-running agent loops where tokens expire mid-session. ([#223](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/223) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

- **`/hotkeys` command**: Shows all keyboard shortcuts in a formatted table.

- **Markdown table borders**: Tables now render with proper top and bottom borders.

### Changed

- **Subagent example improvements**: Parallel mode now streams updates from all tasks. Chain mode shows all completed steps during streaming. Expanded view uses proper markdown rendering with syntax highlighting. Usage footer shows turn count.

- **Skills standard compliance**: Skills now adhere to the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/specification). Validates name (must match parent directory, lowercase, max 64 chars), description (required, max 1024 chars), and frontmatter fields. Warns on violations but remains lenient. Prompt format changed to XML structure. Removed `{baseDir}` placeholder in favor of relative paths. ([#231](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/231))

### Fixed

- **JSON mode stdout flush**: Fixed race condition where `omp --mode json` could exit before all output was written to stdout, causing consumers to miss final events.

- **Symlinked tools, hooks, and slash commands**: Discovery now correctly follows symlinks when scanning for custom tools, hooks, and slash commands. ([#219](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/219), [#232](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/232) by [@aliou](https://github.com/aliou))

### Breaking Changes

- **Custom tools now require `index.ts` entry point**: Auto-discovered custom tools must be in a subdirectory with an `index.ts` file. The old pattern `~/.omp/agent/tools/mytool.ts` must become `~/.omp/agent/tools/mytool/index.ts`. This allows multi-file tools to import helper modules. Explicit paths via `--tool` or `settings.json` still work with any `.ts` file.

- **Hook `tool_result` event restructured**: The `ToolResultEvent` now exposes full tool result data instead of just text. ([#233](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/233))
  - Removed: `result: string` field
  - Added: `content: (TextContent | ImageContent)[]` - full content array
  - Added: `details: unknown` - tool-specific details (typed per tool via discriminated union on `toolName`)
  - `ToolResultEventResult.result` renamed to `ToolResultEventResult.text` (removed), use `content` instead
  - Hook handlers returning `{ result: "..." }` must change to `{ content: [{ type: "text", text: "..." }] }`
  - Built-in tool details types exported: `BashToolDetails`, `ReadToolDetails`, `GrepToolDetails`, `FindToolDetails`, `LsToolDetails`, `TruncationResult`
  - Type guards exported for narrowing: `isBashToolResult`, `isReadToolResult`, `isEditToolResult`, `isWriteToolResult`, `isGrepToolResult`, `isFindToolResult`, `isLsToolResult`

## [0.23.4] - 2025-12-18

### Added

- **Syntax highlighting**: Added syntax highlighting for markdown code blocks, read tool output, and write tool content. Uses cli-highlight with theme-aware color mapping and VS Code-style syntax colors. ([#214](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/214) by [@svkozak](https://github.com/svkozak))

- **Intra-line diff highlighting**: Edit tool now shows word-level changes with inverse highlighting when a single line is modified. Multi-line changes show all removed lines first, then all added lines.

### Fixed

- **Gemini tool result format**: Fixed tool result format for Gemini 3 Flash Preview which strictly requires `{ output: value }` for success and `{ error: value }` for errors. Previous format using `{ result, isError }` was rejected by newer Gemini models. ([#213](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/213), [#220](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/220))

- **Google baseUrl configuration**: Google provider now respects `baseUrl` configuration for custom endpoints or API proxies. ([#216](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/216), [#221](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/221) by [@theBucky](https://github.com/theBucky))

- **Google provider FinishReason**: Added handling for new `IMAGE_RECITATION` and `IMAGE_OTHER` finish reasons. Upgraded @google/genai to 1.34.0.

## [0.23.3] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed

- Check for compaction before submitting user prompt, not just after agent turn ends. This catches cases where user aborts mid-response and context is already near the limit.

### Changed

- Improved system prompt documentation section with clearer pointers to specific doc files for custom models, themes, skills, hooks, custom tools, and RPC.

- Cleaned up documentation:
  - `theme.md`: Added missing color tokens (`thinkingXhigh`, `bashMode`)
  - `skills.md`: Rewrote with better framing and examples
  - `hooks.md`: Fixed timeout/error handling docs, added import aliases section
  - `custom-tools.md`: Added intro with use cases and comparison table
  - `rpc.md`: Added missing `hook_error` event documentation
  - `README.md`: Complete settings table, condensed philosophy section, standardized OAuth docs

- Hooks loader now supports same import aliases as custom tools (`@sinclair/typebox`, `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai`, `@oh-my-pi/pi-tui`, `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent`).

### Breaking Changes

- **Hooks**: `turn_end` event's `toolResults` type changed from `AppMessage[]` to `ToolResultMessage[]`. If you have hooks that handle `turn_end` events and explicitly type the results, update your type annotations.

## [0.23.2] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed

- Fixed Claude models via GitHub Copilot re-answering all previous prompts in multi-turn conversations. The issue was that assistant message content was sent as an array instead of a string, which Copilot's Claude adapter misinterpreted. Also added missing `Openai-Intent: conversation-edits` header and fixed `X-Initiator` logic to check for any assistant/tool message in history. ([#209](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/209))

- Detect image MIME type via file magic (read tool and `@file` attachments), not filename extension.

- Fixed markdown tables overflowing terminal width. Tables now wrap cell contents to fit available width instead of breaking borders mid-row. ([#206](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/206) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

## [0.23.1] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed

- Fixed TUI performance regression caused by Box component lacking render caching. Built-in tools now use Text directly (like v0.22.5), and Box has proper caching for custom tool rendering.

- Fixed custom tools failing to load from `~/.omp/agent/tools/` when omp is installed globally. Module imports (`@sinclair/typebox`, `@oh-my-pi/pi-tui`, `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai`) are now resolved via aliases.

## [0.23.0] - 2025-12-17

### Added

- **Custom tools**: Extend omp with custom tools written in TypeScript. Tools can provide custom TUI rendering, interact with users via `omp.ui` (select, confirm, input, notify), and maintain state across sessions via `onSession` callback. See [docs/custom-tools.md](docs/custom-tools.md) and [examples/custom-tools/](examples/custom-tools/). ([#190](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/190))

- **Hook and tool examples**: Added `examples/hooks/` and `examples/custom-tools/` with working examples. Examples are now bundled in npm and binary releases.

### Breaking Changes

- **Hooks**: Replaced `session_start` and `session_switch` events with unified `session` event. Use `event.reason` (`"start" | "switch" | "clear"`) to distinguish. Event now includes `entries` array for state reconstruction.

## [0.22.5] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed

- Fixed `--session` flag not saving sessions in print mode (`-p`). The session manager was never receiving events because no subscriber was attached.

## [0.22.4] - 2025-12-17

### Added

- `--list-models [search]` CLI flag to list available models with optional fuzzy search. Shows provider, model ID, context window, max output, thinking support, and image support. Only lists models with configured API keys. ([#203](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/203))

### Fixed

- Fixed tool execution showing green (success) background while still running. Now correctly shows gray (pending) background until the tool completes.

## [0.22.3] - 2025-12-16

### Added

- **Streaming bash output**: Bash tool now streams output in real-time during execution. The TUI displays live progress with the last 5 lines visible (expandable with ctrl+o). ([#44](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/44))

### Changed

- **Tool output display**: When collapsed, tool output now shows the last N lines instead of the first N lines, making streaming output more useful.

- Updated `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai` with X-Initiator header support for GitHub Copilot, ensuring agent calls are not deducted from quota. ([#200](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/200) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

### Fixed

- Fixed editor text being cleared during compaction. Text typed while compaction is running is now preserved. ([#179](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/179))
- Improved RGB to 256-color mapping for terminals without truecolor support. Now correctly uses grayscale ramp for neutral colors and preserves semantic tints (green for success, red for error, blue for pending) instead of mapping everything to wrong cube colors.
- `/think off` now actually disables thinking for all providers. Previously, providers like Gemini with "dynamic thinking" enabled by default would still use thinking even when turned off. ([#180](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/180) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.22.2] - 2025-12-15

### Changed

- Updated `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai` with interleaved thinking enabled by default for Anthropic Claude 4 models.

## [0.22.1] - 2025-12-15

_Dedicated to Peter's shoulder ([@steipete](https://twitter.com/steipete))_

### Changed

- Updated `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai` with interleaved thinking support for Anthropic models.

## [0.22.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added

- **GitHub Copilot support**: Use GitHub Copilot models via OAuth login (`/login` -> "GitHub Copilot"). Supports both github.com and GitHub Enterprise. Models are sourced from models.dev and include Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok, and more. All models are automatically enabled after login. ([#191](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/191) by [@cau1k](https://github.com/cau1k))

### Fixed

- Model selector fuzzy search now matches against provider name (not just model ID) and supports space-separated tokens where all tokens must match

## [0.21.0] - 2025-12-14

### Added

- **Inline image rendering**: Terminals supporting Kitty graphics protocol (Kitty, Ghostty, WezTerm) or iTerm2 inline images now render images inline in tool output. Aspect ratio is preserved by querying terminal cell dimensions on startup. Toggle with `/show-images` command or `terminal.showImages` setting. Falls back to text placeholder on unsupported terminals or when disabled. ([#177](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/177) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

- **Gemini 3 Pro thinking levels**: Thinking level selector now works with Gemini 3 Pro models. Minimal/low map to Google's LOW, medium/high map to Google's HIGH. ([#176](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/176) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

### Fixed

- Fixed read tool failing on macOS screenshot filenames due to Unicode Narrow No-Break Space (U+202F) in timestamp. Added fallback to try macOS variant paths and consolidated duplicate expandPath functions into shared path-utils.ts. ([#181](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/181) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

- Fixed double blank lines rendering after markdown code blocks ([#173](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/173) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.20.1] - 2025-12-13

### Added

- **Exported skills API**: `loadSkillsFromDir`, `formatSkillsForPrompt`, and related types are now exported for use by other packages (e.g., mom).

## [0.20.0] - 2025-12-13

### Breaking Changes

- **OMP skills now use `SKILL.md` convention**: OMP skills must now be named `SKILL.md` inside a directory, matching Codex CLI format. Previously any `*.md` file was treated as a skill. Migrate by renaming `~/.omp/agent/skills/foo.md` to `~/.omp/agent/skills/foo/SKILL.md`.

### Added

- Display loaded skills on startup in interactive mode

## [0.19.1] - 2025-12-12

### Fixed

- Documentation: Added skills system documentation to README (setup, usage, CLI flags, settings)

## [0.19.0] - 2025-12-12

### Added

- **Skills system**: Auto-discover and load instruction files on-demand. Supports Claude Code (`~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`), Codex CLI (`~/.codex/skills/`), and OMP-native formats (`~/.omp/agent/skills/`, `.omp/skills/`). Skills are listed in system prompt with descriptions, agent loads them via read tool when needed. Supports `{baseDir}` placeholder. Disable with `--no-skills` or `skills.enabled: false` in settings. ([#169](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/169))

- **Version flag**: Added `--version` / `-v` flag to display the current version and exit. ([#170](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/170))

## [0.18.2] - 2025-12-11

### Added

- **Auto-retry on transient errors**: Automatically retries requests when providers return overloaded, rate limit, or server errors (429, 500, 502, 503, 504). Uses exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s). Shows retry status in TUI with option to cancel via Escape. Configurable in `settings.json` via `retry.enabled`, `retry.maxRetries`, `retry.baseDelayMs`. RPC mode emits `auto_retry_start` and `auto_retry_end` events. ([#157](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/157))

- **HTML export line numbers**: Read tool calls in HTML exports now display line number ranges (e.g., `file.txt:10-20`) when offset/limit parameters are used, matching the TUI display format. Line numbers appear in yellow color for better visibility. ([#166](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/166))

### Fixed

- **Branch selector now works with single message**: Previously the branch selector would not open when there was only one user message. Now it correctly allows branching from any message, including the first one. This is needed for checkpoint hooks to restore state from before the first message. ([#163](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/163))

- **In-memory branching for `--no-session` mode**: Branching now works correctly in `--no-session` mode without creating any session files. The conversation is truncated in memory.

- **Git branch indicator now works in subdirectories**: The footer's git branch detection now walks up the directory hierarchy to find the git root, so it works when running omp from a subdirectory of a repository. ([#156](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/156))

## [0.18.1] - 2025-12-10

### Added

- **Mistral provider**: Added support for Mistral AI models. Set `MISTRAL_API_KEY` environment variable to use.

### Fixed

- Fixed print mode (`-p`) not exiting after output when custom themes are present (theme watcher now properly stops in print mode) ([#161](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/161))

## [0.18.0] - 2025-12-10

### Added

- **Hooks system**: TypeScript modules that extend agent behavior by subscribing to lifecycle events. Hooks can intercept tool calls, prompt for confirmation, modify results, and inject messages from external sources. Auto-discovered from `~/.omp/agent/hooks/*.ts` and `.omp/hooks/*.ts`. Thanks to [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon) for the collaboration on the design and implementation. ([#145](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/145), supersedes [#158](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/158))

- **`pi.send()` API**: Hooks can inject messages into the agent session from external sources (file watchers, webhooks, CI systems). If streaming, messages are queued; otherwise a new agent loop starts immediately.

- **`--hook <path>` CLI flag**: Load hook files directly for testing without modifying settings.

- **Hook events**: `session_start`, `session_switch`, `agent_start`, `agent_end`, `turn_start`, `turn_end`, `tool_call` (can block), `tool_result` (can modify), `branch`.

- **Hook UI primitives**: `ctx.ui.select()`, `ctx.ui.confirm()`, `ctx.ui.input()`, `ctx.ui.notify()` for interactive prompts from hooks.

- **Hooks documentation**: Full API reference at `docs/hooks.md`, shipped with npm package.

## [0.17.0] - 2025-12-09

### Changed

- **Simplified compaction flow**: Removed proactive compaction (aborting mid-turn when threshold approached). Compaction now triggers in two cases only: (1) overflow error from LLM, which compacts and auto-retries, or (2) threshold crossed after a successful turn, which compacts without retry.

- **Compaction retry uses `Agent.continue()`**: Auto-retry after overflow now uses the new `continue()` API instead of re-sending the user message, preserving exact context state.

- **Merged turn prefix summary**: When a turn is split during compaction, the turn prefix summary is now merged into the main history summary instead of being stored separately.

### Added

- **`isCompacting` property on AgentSession**: Check if auto-compaction is currently running.

- **Session compaction indicator**: When resuming a compacted session, displays "Session compacted N times" status message.

### Fixed

- **Block input during compaction**: User input is now blocked while auto-compaction is running to prevent race conditions.

- **Skip error messages in usage calculation**: Context size estimation now skips both aborted and error messages, as neither have valid usage data.

## [0.16.0] - 2025-12-09

### Breaking Changes

- **New RPC protocol**: The RPC mode (`--mode rpc`) has been completely redesigned with a new JSON protocol. The old protocol is no longer supported. See [`docs/rpc.md`](docs/rpc.md) for the new protocol documentation and [`test/rpc-example.ts`](test/rpc-example.ts) for a working example. Includes `RpcClient` TypeScript class for easy integration. ([#91](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/91))

### Changed

- **README restructured**: Reorganized documentation from 30+ flat sections into 10 logical groups. Converted verbose subsections to scannable tables. Consolidated philosophy sections. Reduced size by ~60% while preserving all information.

## [0.15.0] - 2025-12-09

### Changed

- **Major code refactoring**: Restructured codebase for better maintainability and separation of concerns. Moved files into organized directories (`core/`, `modes/`, `utils/`, `cli/`). Extracted `AgentSession` class as central session management abstraction. Split `main.ts` and `tui-renderer.ts` into focused modules. See `DEVELOPMENT.md` for the new code map. ([#153](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/153))

## [0.14.2] - 2025-12-08

### Added

- `/debug` command now includes agent messages as JSONL in the output

### Fixed

- Fix crash when bash command outputs binary data (e.g., `curl` downloading a video file)

## [0.14.1] - 2025-12-08

### Fixed

- Fix build errors with tsgo 7.0.0-dev.20251208.1 by properly importing `ReasoningEffort` type

## [0.14.0] - 2025-12-08

### Breaking Changes

- **Custom themes require new color tokens**: Themes must now include `thinkingXhigh` and `bashMode` color tokens. The theme loader provides helpful error messages listing missing tokens. See built-in themes (dark.json, light.json) for reference values.

### Added

- **OpenAI compatibility overrides in models.json**: Custom models using `openai-completions` API can now specify a `compat` object to override provider quirks (`supportsStore`, `supportsDeveloperRole`, `supportsReasoningEffort`, `maxTokensField`). Useful for LiteLLM, custom proxies, and other non-standard endpoints. ([#133](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/133), thanks @fink-andreas for the initial idea and PR)

- **xhigh thinking level**: Added `xhigh` thinking level for OpenAI codex-max models. Cycle through thinking levels with Shift+Tab; `xhigh` appears only when using a codex-max model. ([#143](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/143))

- **Collapse changelog setting**: Add `"collapseChangelog": true` to `~/.omp/agent/settings.json` to show a condensed "Updated to vX.Y.Z" message instead of the full changelog after updates. Use `/changelog` to view the full changelog. ([#148](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/148))

- **Bash mode**: Execute shell commands directly from the editor by prefixing with `!` (e.g., `!ls -la`). Output streams in real-time, is added to the LLM context, and persists in session history. Supports multiline commands, cancellation (Escape), truncation for large outputs, and preview/expand toggle (Ctrl+O). Also available in RPC mode via `{"type":"bash","command":"..."}`. ([#112](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/112), original implementation by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.13.2] - 2025-12-07

### Changed

- **Tool output truncation**: All tools now enforce consistent truncation limits with actionable notices for the LLM. ([#134](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/134))
  - **Limits**: 2000 lines OR 50KB (whichever hits first), never partial lines
  - **read**: Shows `[Showing lines X-Y of Z. Use offset=N to continue]`. If first line exceeds 50KB, suggests bash command
  - **bash**: Tail truncation with temp file. Shows `[Showing lines X-Y of Z. Full output: /tmp/...]`
  - **grep**: Pre-truncates match lines to 500 chars. Shows match limit and line truncation notices
  - **find/ls**: Shows result/entry limit notices
  - TUI displays truncation warnings in yellow at bottom of tool output (visible even when collapsed)

## [0.13.1] - 2025-12-06

### Added

- **Flexible Windows shell configuration**: The bash tool now supports multiple shell sources beyond Git Bash. Resolution order: (1) custom `shellPath` in settings.json, (2) Git Bash in standard locations, (3) any bash.exe on PATH. This enables Cygwin, MSYS2, and other bash environments. Configure with `~/.omp/agent/settings.json`: `{"shellPath": "C:\\cygwin64\\bin\\bash.exe"}`.

### Fixed

- **Windows binary detection**: Fixed Bun compiled binary detection on Windows by checking for URL-encoded `%7EBUN` in addition to `$bunfs` and `~BUN` in `import.meta.url`. This ensures the binary correctly locates supporting files (package.json, themes, etc.) next to the executable.

## [0.12.15] - 2025-12-06

### Fixed

- **Editor crash with emojis/CJK characters**: Fixed crash when pasting or typing text containing wide characters (emojis like ✅, CJK characters) that caused line width to exceed terminal width. The editor now uses grapheme-aware text wrapping with proper visible width calculation.

## [0.12.14] - 2025-12-06

### Added

- **Double-Escape Branch Shortcut**: Press Escape twice with an empty editor to quickly open the `/branch` selector for conversation branching.

## [0.12.13] - 2025-12-05

### Changed

- **Faster startup**: Version check now runs in parallel with TUI initialization instead of blocking startup for up to 1 second. Update notifications appear in chat when the check completes.

## [0.12.12] - 2025-12-05

### Changed

- **Footer display**: Token counts now use M suffix for millions (e.g., `10.2M` instead of `10184k`). Context display shortened from `61.3% of 200k` to `61.3%/200k`.

### Fixed

- **Multi-key sequences in inputs**: Inputs like model search now handle multi-key sequences identically to the main prompt editor. ([#122](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/122) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))
- **Line wrapping escape codes**: Fixed underline style bleeding into padding when wrapping long URLs. ANSI codes now attach to the correct content, and line-end resets only turn off underline (preserving background colors). ([#109](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/109))

### Added

- **Fuzzy search models and sessions**: Implemented a simple fuzzy search for models and sessions (e.g., `codexmax` now finds `gpt-5.1-codex-max`). ([#122](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/122) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))
- **Prompt History Navigation**: Browse previously submitted prompts using Up/Down arrow keys when the editor is empty. Press Up to cycle through older prompts, Down to return to newer ones or clear the editor. Similar to shell history and Claude Code's prompt history feature. History is session-scoped and stores up to 100 entries. ([#121](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/121) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))
- **`/resume` Command**: Switch to a different session mid-conversation. Opens an interactive selector showing all available sessions. Equivalent to the `--resume` CLI flag but can be used without restarting the agent. ([#117](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/117) by [@hewliyang](https://github.com/hewliyang))

## [0.12.11] - 2025-12-05

### Changed

- **Compaction UI**: Simplified collapsed compaction indicator to show warning-colored text with token count instead of styled banner. Removed redundant success message after compaction. ([#108](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/108))

### Fixed

- **Print mode error handling**: `-p` flag now outputs error messages and exits with code 1 when requests fail, instead of silently producing no output.
- **Branch selector crash**: Fixed TUI crash when user messages contained Unicode characters (like `✔` or `›`) that caused line width to exceed terminal width. Now uses proper `truncateToWidth` instead of `substring`.
- **Bash output escape sequences**: Fixed incomplete stripping of terminal escape sequences in bash tool output. `stripAnsi` misses some sequences like standalone String Terminator (`ESC \`), which could cause rendering issues when displaying captured TUI output.
- **Footer overflow crash**: Fixed TUI crash when terminal width is too narrow for the footer stats line. The footer now truncates gracefully instead of overflowing.

### Added

- **`authHeader` option in models.json**: Custom providers can set `"authHeader": true` to automatically add `Authorization: Bearer <apiKey>` header. Useful for providers that require explicit auth headers. ([#81](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/81))
- **`--append-system-prompt` Flag**: Append additional text or file contents to the system prompt. Supports both inline text and file paths. Complements `--system-prompt` for layering custom instructions without replacing the base system prompt. ([#114](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/114) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))
- **Thinking Block Toggle**: Added `Ctrl+T` shortcut to toggle visibility of LLM thinking blocks. When toggled off, shows a static "Thinking..." label instead of full content. Useful for reducing visual clutter during long conversations. ([#113](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/113) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.12.10] - 2025-12-04

### Added

- Added `gpt-5.1-codex-max` model support

## [0.12.9] - 2025-12-04

### Added

- **`/copy` Command**: Copy the last agent message to clipboard. Works cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux). Useful for extracting text from rendered Markdown output. ([#105](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/105) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.12.8] - 2025-12-04

- Fix: Use CTRL+O consistently for compaction expand shortcut (not CMD+O on Mac)

## [0.12.7] - 2025-12-04

### Added

- **Context Compaction**: Long sessions can now be compacted to reduce context usage while preserving recent conversation history. ([#92](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/92), [docs](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/README.md#context-compaction))
  - `/compact [instructions]`: Manually compact context with optional custom instructions for the summary
  - `/autocompact`: Toggle automatic compaction when context exceeds threshold
  - Compaction summarizes older messages while keeping recent messages (default 20k tokens) verbatim
  - Auto-compaction triggers when context reaches `contextWindow - reserveTokens` (default 16k reserve)
  - Compacted sessions show a collapsible summary in the TUI (toggle with `o` key)
  - HTML exports include compaction summaries as collapsible sections
  - RPC mode supports `{"type":"compact"}` command and auto-compaction (emits compaction events)
- **Branch Source Tracking**: Branched sessions now store `branchedFrom` in the session header, containing the path to the original session file. Useful for tracing session lineage.

## [0.12.5] - 2025-12-03

### Added

- **Forking/Rebranding Support**: All branding (app name, config directory, environment variable names) is now configurable via `ompConfig` in `package.json`. Forks can change `ompConfig.name` and `ompConfig.configDir` to rebrand the CLI without code changes. Affects CLI banner, help text, config paths, and error messages. ([#95](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/95))

### Fixed

- **Bun Binary Detection**: Fixed Bun compiled binary failing to start after Bun updated its virtual filesystem path format from `%7EBUN` to `$bunfs`. ([#95](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/95))

## [0.12.4] - 2025-12-02

### Added

- **RPC Termination Safeguard**: When running as an RPC worker (stdin pipe detected), the CLI now exits immediately if the parent process terminates unexpectedly. Prevents orphaned RPC workers from persisting indefinitely and consuming system resources.

## [0.12.3] - 2025-12-02

### Fixed

- **Rate limit handling**: Anthropic rate limit errors now trigger automatic retry with exponential backoff (base 10s, max 5 retries). Previously these errors would abort the request immediately.
- **Usage tracking during retries**: Retried requests now correctly accumulate token usage from all attempts, not just the final successful one. Fixes artificially low token counts when requests were retried.

## [0.12.2] - 2025-12-02

### Changed

- Removed support for gpt-4.5-preview and o3 models (not yet available)

## [0.12.1] - 2025-12-02

### Added

- **Models**: Added support for OpenAI's new models:
  - `gpt-4.1` (128K context)
  - `gpt-4.1-mini` (128K context)
  - `gpt-4.1-nano` (128K context)
  - `o3` (200K context, reasoning model)
  - `o4-mini` (200K context, reasoning model)

## [0.12.0] - 2025-12-02

### Added

- **`-p, --print` Flag**: Run in non-interactive batch mode. Processes input message or piped stdin without TUI, prints agent response directly to stdout. Ideal for scripting, piping, and CI/CD integration. Exits after first response.
- **`-P, --print-streaming` Flag**: Like `-p`, but streams response tokens as they arrive. Use `--print-streaming --no-markdown` for raw unformatted output.
- **`--print-turn` Flag**: Continue processing tool calls and agent turns until the agent naturally finishes or requires user input. Combine with `-p` for complete multi-turn conversations.
- **`--no-markdown` Flag**: Output raw text without Markdown formatting. Useful when piping output to tools that expect plain text.
- **Streaming Print Mode**: Added internal `printStreaming` option for streaming output in non-TUI mode.
- **RPC Mode `print` Command**: Send `{"type":"print","content":"text"}` to get formatted print output via `print_output` events.
- **Auto-Save in Print Mode**: Print mode conversations are automatically saved to the session directory, allowing later resumption with `--continue`.
- **Thinking level options**: Added `--thinking-off`, `--thinking-minimal`, `--thinking-low`, `--thinking-medium`, `--thinking-high` flags for directly specifying thinking level without the selector UI.

### Changed

- **Simplified RPC Protocol**: Replaced the `prompt` wrapper command with direct message objects. Send `{"role":"user","content":"text"}` instead of `{"type":"prompt","message":"text"}`. Better aligns with message format throughout the codebase.
- **RPC Message Handling**: Agent now processes raw message objects directly, with `timestamp` auto-populated if missing.

## [0.11.9] - 2025-12-02

### Changed

- Change Ctrl+I to Ctrl+P for model cycling shortcut to avoid collision with Tab key in some terminals

## [0.11.8] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed

- Absolute glob patterns (e.g., `/Users/foo/**/*.ts`) are now handled correctly. Previously the leading `/` was being stripped, causing the pattern to be interpreted relative to the current directory.

## [0.11.7] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed

- Fix read path traversal vulnerability. Paths are now validated to prevent reading outside the working directory or its parents. The `read` tool can read from `cwd`, its ancestors (for config files), and all descendants. Symlinks are resolved before validation.

## [0.11.6] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed

- Fix `--system-prompt <path>` allowing the path argument to be captured by the message collection, causing "file not found" errors.

## [0.11.5] - 2025-11-30

### Fixed

- Fixed fatal error "Cannot set properties of undefined (setting '0')" when editing empty files in the `edit` tool.
- Simplified `edit` tool output: Shows only "Edited file.txt" for successful edits instead of verbose search/replace details.
- Fixed fatal error in footer rendering when token counts contain NaN values due to missing usage data.

## [0.11.4] - 2025-11-30

### Fixed

- Fixed chat rendering crash when messages contain preformatted/styled text (e.g., thinking traces with gray italic styling). The markdown renderer now preserves existing ANSI escape codes when they appear before inline elements.

## [0.11.3] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- Fix file drop functionality for absolute paths

## [0.11.2] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed

- Fixed TUI crash when pasting content containing tab characters. Tabs are now converted to 4 spaces before insertion.
- Fixed terminal corruption after exit when shell integration sequences (OSC 133) appeared in bash output. These sequences are now stripped along with other ANSI codes.

## [0.11.1] - 2025-11-29

### Added

- Added `fd` integration for file path autocompletion. Now uses `fd` for faster fuzzy file search

### Fixed

- Fixed keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+A, Ctrl+E, Ctrl+K, Ctrl+U, Ctrl+W, and word navigation (Option+Arrow) not working in VS Code integrated terminal and some other terminal emulators

## [0.11.0] - 2025-11-29

### Added

- **File-based Slash Commands**: Create custom reusable prompts as `.txt` files in `~/.omp/slash-commands/`. Files become `/filename` commands with first-line descriptions. Supports `{{selection}}` placeholder for referencing selected/attached content.
- **`/branch` Command**: Create conversation branches from any previous user message. Opens a selector to pick a message, then creates a new session file starting from that point. Original message text is placed in the editor for modification.
- **Unified Content References**: Both `@path` in messages and `--file path` CLI arguments now use the same attachment system with consistent MIME type detection.
- **Drag & Drop Files**: Drop files onto the terminal to attach them to your message. Supports multiple files and both text and image content.

### Changed

- **Model Selector with Search**: The `/model` command now opens a searchable list. Type to filter models by name, use arrows to navigate, Enter to select.
- **Improved File Autocomplete**: File path completion after `@` now supports fuzzy matching and shows file/directory indicators.
- **Session Selector with Search**: The `--resume` and `--session` flags now open a searchable session list with fuzzy filtering.
- **Attachment Display**: Files added via `@path` are now shown as "Attached: filename" in the user message, separate from the prompt text.
- **Tab Completion**: Tab key now triggers file path autocompletion anywhere in the editor, not just after `@` symbol.

### Fixed

- Fixed autocomplete z-order issue where dropdown could appear behind chat messages
- Fixed cursor position when navigating through wrapped lines in the editor
- Fixed attachment handling for continued sessions to preserve file references

## [0.10.6] - 2025-11-28

### Changed

- Show base64-truncated indicator for large images in tool output

### Fixed

- Fixed image dimensions not being read correctly from PNG/JPEG/GIF files
- Fixed PDF images being incorrectly base64-truncated in display
- Allow reading files from ancestor directories (needed for monorepo configs)

## [0.10.5] - 2025-11-28

### Added

- Full multimodal support: attach images (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP) and PDFs to prompts using `@path` syntax or `--file` flag

### Fixed

- `@`-references now handle special characters in file names (spaces, quotes, unicode)
- Fixed cursor positioning issues with multi-byte unicode characters in editor

## [0.10.4] - 2025-11-28

### Fixed

- Removed padding on first user message in TUI to improve visual consistency.

## [0.10.3] - 2025-11-28

### Added

- Added RPC mode (`--rpc`) for programmatic integration. Accepts JSON commands on stdin, emits JSON events on stdout. See [RPC mode documentation](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/README.md#rpc-mode) for protocol details.

### Changed

- Refactored internal architecture to support multiple frontends (TUI, RPC) with shared agent logic.

## [0.10.2] - 2025-11-26

### Added

- Added thinking level persistence. Default level stored in `~/.omp/settings.json`, restored on startup. Per-session overrides saved in session files.
- Added model cycling shortcut: `Ctrl+I` cycles through available models (or scoped models with `-m` flag).
- Added automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient API errors (network issues, 500s, overload).
- Cumulative token usage now shown in footer (total tokens used across all messages in session).
- Added `--system-prompt` flag to override default system prompt with custom text or file contents.
- Footer now shows estimated total cost in USD based on model pricing.

### Changed

- Replaced `--models` flag with `-m/--model` supporting multiple values. Specify models as `provider/model@thinking` (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514@high`). Multiple `-m` flags scope available models for the session.
- Thinking level border now persists visually after selector closes.
- Improved tool result display with collapsible output (default collapsed, expand with `Ctrl+O`).

## [0.10.1] - 2025-11-25
