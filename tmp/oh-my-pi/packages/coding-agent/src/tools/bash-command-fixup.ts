/**
 * Conservative transforms applied to a bash command before execution.
 *
 * Two fixups are applied, each anchored to the end of a top-level segment
 * (segments split on `;`, `&&`, `||`, and background `&`):
 *
 *  1. Trailing `| head [args]` / `| tail [args]` (and the `|&` variant) — these
 *     pipes exist purely to limit output length. The harness already truncates
 *     bash output and exposes the full result via an artifact, so they only
 *     hide content the agent wanted.
 *
 *  2. A redundant trailing `2>&1` left on a segment that has no remaining pipe
 *     or other redirect. The harness already merges stderr into stdout, so the
 *     duplication is purely cosmetic — and often a leftover after fixup (1)
 *     drops a downstream pipe.
 *
 * The heavy lifting (tokenization, quoting, heredoc handling, command
 * substitution, nested compound commands) lives in Rust under
 * `pi_shell::fixup`, driven by the real `brush-parser` AST. This module is a
 * thin sync wrapper plus user-facing notice formatting.
