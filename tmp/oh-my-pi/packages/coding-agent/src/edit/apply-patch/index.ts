/**
 * Multi-file orchestrator for the Codex `apply_patch` envelope.

 * Decoupled from tool-registration: takes raw patch text + options, parses
 * it, and applies each hunk via the existing single-file `applyPatch` in
 * `../modes/patch.ts`. A future OpenAI freeform/grammar tool variant can
 * call this directly with the raw grammar output.
 *
 * Per spec §6.1, hunks are applied in order and NOT atomically — if hunk
 * N fails, hunks `0..N-1` are already on disk. We surface that by
 * returning the per-file results alongside the error when it happens.
