/**
 * Rule bucketing
 *
 * Single funnel that every discovered rule passes through on its way into a
 * session. It applies the user's disable levers, registers TTSR rules with the
 * manager, and splits the rest into the always-apply and rulebook buckets.
 *
 * Bucket precedence (matches docs/rulebook-matching-pipeline.md §5):
 *   1. TTSR     — non-empty `condition` that `TtsrManager.addRule` accepts
 *   2. always   — `alwaysApply === true`
 *   3. rulebook — has a `description`
