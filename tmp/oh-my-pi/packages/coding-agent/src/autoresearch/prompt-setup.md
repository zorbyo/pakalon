## Autoresearch Mode — Phase 1: Harness Setup

Autoresearch mode is active and there is no session yet. Your job in this turn is to **build the benchmark harness**, not to optimise anything. Optimisation starts only after you call `init_experiment`.

{{#if has_goal}}
Primary goal (for context — implement the harness so it can measure this):
{{goal}}
{{else}}
There is no goal recorded yet. Infer what to optimise from the latest user message and design the harness to measure that. Capture the goal when you call `init_experiment`.
{{/if}}

Working directory: `{{working_dir}}`
{{#if has_branch}}Active branch: `{{branch}}`{{/if}}
{{#if has_baseline_warning}}

{{baseline_warning}}
{{/if}}

### What you must produce

Write `./autoresearch.sh` at the working directory. It is the canonical benchmark entrypoint and must:

- exit 0 on success and non-zero on failure;
- print the primary metric as a single line `METRIC <name>=<value>`;
- print any secondary metrics as additional `METRIC <name>=<value>` lines;
- run the same workload deterministically every time (no live network, no time-of-day dependencies, fixed seeds where applicable).

You **may** edit anything else needed to make `autoresearch.sh` work — benchmark binaries, `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, helper scripts, fixtures. All those edits are part of the harness baseline and will be committed for you when you call `init_experiment` on an autoresearch branch.

### Steps

1. Inspect the target. Read source, identify what to measure, decide on the workload.
2. Write `autoresearch.sh` plus any supporting files (benchmark binaries, fixtures, etc.).
3. Validate it: invoke `bash autoresearch.sh` through the regular `bash` tool. Confirm it exits 0 and emits at least one `METRIC` line. Iterate on the harness until it does.
4. Call `init_experiment` with the goal, primary metric (matching the `METRIC` name), and scope. This snapshots the worktree as the baseline and starts Phase 2 (the iteration loop).

### Rules

- Do **not** call `run_experiment`, `log_experiment`, or `update_notes` yet. They will error with "no active autoresearch session" until `init_experiment` runs.
- Do **not** treat a compile-only check as a benchmark. The harness must actually execute the workload and emit `METRIC`.
- Do **not** create `autoresearch.md`, `autoresearch.checks.sh`, `autoresearch.program.md`, `autoresearch.ideas.md`, `autoresearch.jsonl`, `.autoresearch/`, or `autoresearch.config.json`. Session state is tracked for you.
