/**
 * Regression for https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1150
 *
 * In v15.1.3 `omp stats` crashed in the published Linux/macOS/Windows
 * binaries with `BuildMessage: ModuleNotFound resolving
 * "./packages/stats/src/sync-worker.ts" (entry point)`. The dev-mode build
 * script `packages/coding-agent/scripts/build-binary.ts` listed the three
 * worker entrypoints required by AGENTS.md, but the release script
 * `scripts/ci-release-build-binaries.ts` — the one that actually builds the
 * shipped artifacts — did not. The `new Worker("./packages/<pkg>/src/...")`
 * literal at the spawn site fooled Bun's `--compile` static analyzer into
 * keeping the call site, but without the matching `--compile` entrypoint
 * the worker module was never emitted into bunfs and the runtime tried to
 * bundle it on the fly, which fails in `$bunfs`.
 *
 * The contract from AGENTS.md is symmetric: **every** worker spawned via
 * the `isCompiledBinary()` hybrid pattern must be listed as an extra
 * `--compile` entry in **both** scripts. This test pins that contract for
 * the release script; the dev script is covered by `issue-1011-repro` for
 * the tab worker entry. Runtime coverage lives in `omp --smoke-test`,
 * which the release-binary CI step now invokes.
