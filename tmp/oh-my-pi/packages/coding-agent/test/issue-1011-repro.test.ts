/**
 * Regression for https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1011
 *
 * In v14.5.13 `spawnTabWorker` (in `src/tools/browser/tab-supervisor.ts`)
 * resolved the worker entry as `new URL("./tab-worker-entry.ts", import.meta.url)`
 * and passed `.href` to `new Worker(...)`. Bun's `--compile` static analyzer
 * cannot discover that pattern, so the entry was never embedded in the
 * single-file binary and the runtime symptom was "Timed out initializing
 * browser tab worker".
 *
 * The original fix used an `import "./worker.ts" with { type: "file" }`
 * trick. That copied the entry as a raw asset but could not resolve its
 * relative imports inside the compiled binary, so the worker still failed
 * to load (issue #1027 was the same root cause, retriggered).
 *
 * The working pattern documented in AGENTS.md is a two-part contract:
 *
 *   1. `spawnTabWorker` branches on `isCompiledBinary()` and uses a literal
 *      string path under `--compile`. Bun's `--compile` analyzer discovers
 *      that literal at the `new Worker("...", ...)` call site. The path is
 *      `--root`-relative (`./packages/coding-agent/src/...`) because the
 *      build script passes `--root ../..`.
 *   2. `scripts/build-binary.ts` lists the worker as an explicit additional
 *      `--compile` entrypoint. Without this, Bun sees the literal at the
 *      spawn site but never emits the worker module into bunfs.
 *
 * Either half alone is insufficient — both must agree on the exact path.
 * Runtime end-to-end coverage lives in `omp --smoke-test` (via the stats
 * sync worker). This test is the cheap static contract that catches an
 * accidental regression of either half in code review / CI.
