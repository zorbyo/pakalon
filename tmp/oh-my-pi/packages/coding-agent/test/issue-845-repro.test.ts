// Issue #845: on Windows with Bun installed via Scoop, ~/.bun is a junction
// to scoop\persist\Oven-sh.Bun\.bun. `bun pm bin -g` and the omp path that
// $which finds may end up referring to the same directory through different
// path strings (one through the junction, one through the real target).
// `isPathInDirectory` did purely lexical comparison via path.resolve, which
// does not follow filesystem links, so it misclassified Bun-installed omp
// as "binary" and tried to swap omp.exe in place – which fails on Windows
// because Bun has the file open (EPERM on unlink of .bak).
//
// We reproduce the realpath-resolution bug with a symlink (works on macOS /
// Linux; the bug is realpath, not junction-specific).
