/**
 * Per-session snapshot store used by {@link Recovery} and {@link Patcher} to
 * bind hashline section tags to the exact file content that minted them.
 *
 * A section tag is a content-derived hash of the *whole file* (see
 * {@link computeFileHash}). Any read of byte-identical content mints the same
 * tag, so reads of one file state fuse onto one anchor and a follow-up edit
 * anchored at any line validates whenever the live file still hashes to it.
 *
 * Producers (typically `read` / `search` / `write` tools) call
 * {@link SnapshotStore.record} with the full normalized text they observed.
 * The store hashes it, dedups against the per-path history, and returns the
 * tag. Consumers (the patcher) resolve a stale tag back to the recorded full
 * text via {@link SnapshotStore.byHash} and 3-way-merge the would-be edit onto
 * the live content.
 *
 * The abstract base class lets callers plug in whatever storage they like
 * (LRU, persistent SQLite, etc.). {@link InMemorySnapshotStore} ships as a
 * sensible default backed by `lru-cache`: a bounded set of paths, each with a
 * short history of full-file versions so in-session edit chains can still
 * recover against the version a stale tag names.
