/**
 * Pins the session-chain replay fast-path against an anchor-content

 * later stale-hash edit re-targets, replaying onto current must refuse
 * (the model is anchored against content that no longer exists), not
 * silently overwrite the new content with the stale-authored payload.
 *
 * Companion positive case: when the prior edit changed lines elsewhere
 * but left the re-targeted line alone, replay must still succeed and
 * surface the standard session-chain banner.
