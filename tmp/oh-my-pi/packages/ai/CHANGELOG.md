# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic stream idle-timeout retries after the provider stream has already begun.

## [15.7.3] - 2026-05-31

### Changed

- Throttled per-delta streaming JSON re-parsing of OpenAI Responses/Codex tool-call arguments (bounding mid-stream parse cost from O(N²) to O(N)). Finalization via `response.output_item.done` now writes the authoritative full arguments back to the persisted assistant-message block, so tool calls finalized without a trailing `response.function_call_arguments.done` no longer retain stale/empty (`{}`) arguments. ([#1507](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/1507))

## [15.6.0] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic adaptive-thinking replay preserving signed thinking blocks on the latest abandoned tool-use assistant message, avoiding `thinking blocks in the latest assistant message cannot be modified` 400s. ([#1531](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1531))

## [15.5.15] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- Added `PI_REQ_DEBUG=1` request/response recording for provider transports. Each request writes `rr-session-N.json`; each received response writes `rr-session-N.res.log` with response headers followed by raw body bytes.

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenCode-Go dynamic model refresh downgrading `qwen3.7-max` from Anthropic Messages to OpenAI-compatible transport, which caused `401 Model qwen3.7-max is not supported for format oa-compat` after `/v1/models` cache refreshes.

## [15.5.12] - 2026-05-29
### Removed

- Removed ANTML stream markup healing for `antml:function_calls` and `antml:thinking` envelopes, so Anthropic-compatible providers no longer parse those tags into `toolCall`/`thinking` events

### Fixed

- Fixed GLM-5.x coding-plan OpenAI-compatible streams to use a longer default watchdog window, avoiding spurious `OpenAI completions stream stalled while waiting for the next event` errors during slow `glm-5.1` thinking/output phases. ([#1494](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1494))
- Fixed `zhipu-coding-plan` model discovery and credential validation to use the dedicated GLM Coding Plan endpoint (`https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/coding/paas/v4`) instead of the general BigModel endpoint, preventing requests from consuming ordinary account balance. ([#1494](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1494))
- Fixed DeepSeek tool calls failing on NanoGPT (e.g. `nanogpt/deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` with reasoning enabled) by routing tool-bearing DeepSeek requests through NanoGPT's `:tools` model route and adding `nanogpt` to the DSML leak allowlist so streamed `<｜DSML｜tool_calls>...</｜DSML｜tool_calls>` envelopes are healed into structured tool calls instead of being passed through as visible text. ([#1488](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1488))
- Fixed DeepSeek tool calls failing on NanoGPT (e.g. `nanogpt/deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` with reasoning enabled) by adding `nanogpt` to the DSML leak allowlist so streamed `<｜DSML｜tool_calls>...</｜DSML｜tool_calls>` envelopes are healed into structured tool calls instead of being passed through as visible text. The `:tools` model suffix is no longer appended on NanoGPT; that route triggered NanoGPT's server-side tool-call parser and 502'd with `code: "malformed_tool_call"` on complex tool schemas (`todo_write`) — the default route forwards `delta.content` (including DSML envelopes) which is healed client-side. ([#1488](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1488))
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible streamed parallel tool calls losing indexed argument deltas by tracking active tool-call blocks by the provider's `tool_calls[].index`; this keeps parallel NanoGPT `read` calls from merging or dropping their `path` arguments. ([#1488](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1488))

## [15.5.11] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- Added mid-conversation `system` message support for Anthropic Messages by upgrading eligible `developer` turns to `role: "system"` on first-party Claude API with Claude Opus 4.8+ and newer
- Added `supportsMidConversationSystem` to Anthropic compatibility settings so consumers can opt in to or disable mid-conversation `system` role handling per model
- Added `anthropic.claude-opus-4-8` model metadata in the model registry for Bedrock Converse streaming with effort-based thinking support through `xhigh`

### Changed

- Changed Anthropic adaptive-thinking effort mapping for Opus 4.7+ on the Messages API to use the model's full five-tier scale: user-facing efforts now shift up one notch (`minimal→low`, `low→medium`, `medium→high`, `high→xhigh`, `xhigh→max`) so the top tier reaches the genuine `max` level and `high` lands on Anthropic's recommended `xhigh` coding/agentic default. Older adaptive models (Opus 4.6) and Bedrock Converse keep the four-tier legacy mapping where `xhigh` aliases to `max`.

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenCode Zen `400 thinking is enabled but reasoning_content is missing in assistant tool call message` for every model behind `opencode-go`/`opencode-zen` (Kimi K2.x, DeepSeek V4 Pro/Flash, GLM-5.x, Qwen3.x, MiMo, MiniMax) by reactivating `requiresReasoningContentForToolCalls` and pinning the wire field to `reasoning_content` for any opencode request in thinking mode. The static compat default still omits the field for thinking-disabled turns to preserve the `Extra inputs are not permitted` guard from #1071; forced-tool turns also stay off because the existing `disableReasoningOnForcedToolChoice` guard strips thinking from the wire body. ([#1484](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1484))

## [15.5.8] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- Added `CheckCredentialsOptions.completionProbe` (and `completionTimeoutMs`) so `AuthStorage.checkCredentials` can additionally exercise each credential against the provider's chat-completion endpoint after refresh-on-expiry. Result lands on `CredentialHealthResult.completion` ({ok, reason?, modelId?, latencyMs?}) without disturbing the usage `ok` field. Public types: `CompletionProbe`, `CompletionProbeInput`, `CompletionProbeCredential`, `CredentialCompletionResult`. The probe is invoked even when no `UsageProvider` is registered for the row, and is skipped when OAuth refresh fails (the stale bytes would only mask the upstream failure).
- Added Wafer Pass and Wafer Serverless providers (`wafer-pass`, `wafer-serverless`). OpenAI-compatible (`https://pass.wafer.ai/v1`), bearer auth, `wfr_…` keys. `/login wafer-pass` and `/login wafer-serverless` paste-and-validate the key against `/v1/models`. `WAFER_PASS_API_KEY` and `WAFER_SERVERLESS_API_KEY` environment variables wired into `getEnvApiKey`. Bundled catalog seeds `wafer-pass/{GLM-5.1, Qwen3.5-397B-A17B}` and `wafer-serverless/{GLM-5.1, Kimi-K2.6, Qwen3.5-397B-A17B, Qwen3.6-35B-A3B, qwen3.7-max, deepseek-v4-flash, deepseek-v4-pro}`; dynamic discovery via `/v1/models` overlays additional models at runtime. Pass-tier discovery filters `wafer.tier === "pass_included"`. Pass-SKU costs are seeded at `0` (flat-rate subscription, no per-token charge — matches `kimi-code`/`firepass`/`alibaba-coding-plan`). Serverless costs are the wafer.ai retail rate, derived from the `*_cents_per_million` envelope via `value × 125 / 10000` (e.g. GLM-5.1 `120` → $1.50/M, Kimi-K2.6 `88` → $1.10/M). Reasoning entries get a thinking compat picked from the `wafer.provider` envelope: `zai`/`moonshotai` → zai-style `thinking: { type }`, `qwen` → top-level `enable_thinking`, `deepseek` and unknown upstreams stay unset so `detectOpenAICompat` can pick `reasoning_effort` from the id pattern at request time.

### Changed

- Changed auth-gateway credential resolution to use per-conversation `promptCacheKey`/`sessionId` when calling `AuthStorage.getApiKey`, so repeated turns can keep the same credential until it becomes unavailable
- Changed auth-gateway and pi-native request handling to align `sessionId` with prompt/context identity before credential lookup
- Changed Anthropic prompt preparation to downscale image blocks over 2000px when a request includes 20+ images, reducing oversized payloads automatically
- Changed OpenAI chat request parsing to accept `name` on `tool` messages and fall back to the matching assistant `tool_calls` name, so parsed tool results now carry a proper tool name when the wire omits it
- Changed `checkCredentials` to skip running `completionProbe` when OAuth refresh fails, so stale bearer tokens are never probed and the refresh failure remains the returned `reason`
- Changed completion reporting to return `completion: { ok: null, reason: ... }` when a credential has no usable bearer bytes instead of attempting the probe
- Refactored `AuthStorage.checkCredentials` so OAuth refresh-on-expiry runs up-front and the refreshed credential is shared between the usage probe and the new completion probe; rows without a registered `UsageProvider` no longer short-circuit before the completion probe runs.

### Fixed

- Fixed DeepSeek DSML tool-call envelope leaks on Ollama Cloud and OpenAI-compatible streams by healing leaked envelopes into structured tool calls without displaying raw DSML markers. ([#1462](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1462))
- Fixed auth-gateway to classify usage-limit messages such as `usage_limit_reached`, `resource_exhausted`, and Codex-style `Try again in ~X min` text as 429 `rate_limit_error` responses
- Fixed auth-gateway usage-limit handling to honor parsed retry hints and switch to a sibling credential via `markUsageLimitReached` instead of invalidating the rate-limited credential
- Fixed `streamSimple` to retry on usage-limit errors (including message-only error events) before any content is emitted, so `onAuthError` can rotate credentials automatically
- Fixed auth-gateway error classification to extract embedded status codes and use word-boundary matching, so `GenerateContentRequest` and similar messages are no longer misreported as rate-limit errors
- Fixed `checkCredentials` to handle `completionProbe` exceptions by recording the failure in `CredentialHealthResult.completion.reason` while still returning the usage probe result

### Fixed

- Fixed Google Vertex's bundled model list to use the authoritative models.dev catalog, including MaaS entries such as `deepseek-ai/deepseek-v3.2-maas` and removing retired Gemini 1.5 fallbacks. ([#1456](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1456))

## [15.5.7] - 2026-05-27
### Added
- `SimpleStreamOptions.openrouterVariant` (`"nitro"`, `"floor"`, `"online"`, `"exacto"`, …) — when set, appends `:<variant>` to OpenRouter model IDs at request time, leaving ids that already carry an explicit `:suffix` untouched. Plumbed through `openai-completions` and the pi-native gateway forwarder.

- xAI Grok OAuth (SuperGrok Subscription) provider in `/login`. Loopback PKCE flow on `127.0.0.1:56121`; the token unlocks Grok-4.x chat. Ported from NousResearch/hermes-agent (MIT).
- OpenRouter provider in `/login`. API-key paste flow validated against `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/auth/key` (the `/models` endpoint is public and cannot validate auth). The pasted key is stored under the existing `openrouter` provider id used by `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
- `XAI_OAUTH_TOKEN` environment variable accepted as a headless fallback for the xAI Grok OAuth provider.

### Changed

- `OpenAIResponsesOptions` gains four optional, provider-agnostic fields that adapter wrappers can use to compose provider-specific behavior on top of the generic transport: `includeEncryptedReasoning` (gates `include: ["reasoning.encrypted_content"]`; default `true`, preserves current behavior), `filterReasoningHistory` (strips replayed `type: "reasoning"` items from conversation history; default `false`), `headers` (merged onto the client's default headers), and `extraBody` (merged into the request payload).
- The existing `XAI_API_KEY` path is unchanged — it continues to use the OpenAI-completions transport.

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenRouter DeepSeek V4 tool-call follow-up requests replaying normalized `reasoning` as-is instead of DeepSeek's required `reasoning_content`, which caused HTTP 400 errors in thinking mode. ([#1445](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1445))

## [15.5.6] - 2026-05-27
### Added

- Added `PI_CODEX_WEBSOCKET_MAX_IDLE_REUSE_MS` to control how long an idle Codex WebSocket stays eligible for reuse, with `0` disabling the check

### Fixed

- Fixed reused Codex WebSocket connections that had gone silent without activity to be dropped and replaced with a fresh handshake after the idle-reuse threshold, preventing stalled next requests
- Fixed stale response frames left in the websocket queue from a completed turn so subsequent requests no longer process terminal frames from the previous response
- Fixed websocket dead-socket detection to fail a stale connection when no inbound traffic or pong is observed after a ping timeout, improving recovery on runtimes that do not emit pong events

## [15.5.5] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- Added `PI_CODEX_WEBSOCKET_PING_INTERVAL_MS` to configure the interval for Codex WebSocket protocol ping heartbeats
- Added `PI_CODEX_WEBSOCKET_PONG_TIMEOUT_MS` to configure the Codex WebSocket pong timeout used to detect unresponsive connections
- Added `PI_CODEX_WEBSOCKET_MESSAGE_QUEUE_CAPACITY` to configure the maximum buffered Codex WebSocket inbound queue size before transport fallback

### Changed

- Improved Codex WebSocket timeout diagnostics to include last event type and time since last progress event
- Enhanced Codex WebSocket error classification to recognize ping, pong, send, and queue-overflow failures as retryable

### Fixed

- Fixed Codex WebSocket send failures by wrapping socket.send() in try-catch and surfacing errors as retryable transport errors
- Fixed Codex WebSocket inbound queue overflow by adding capacity bounds and triggering fallback to SSE when exceeded
- Fixed Codex WebSocket pong timeout detection by tracking pong events and failing the connection when no pong is received within the configured timeout
- Fixed Anthropic streaming to suppress hallucinated meta-prompt thinking blocks (the recent "I don't see any current rewritten thinking..." regression). When the marker phrase `rewritten thinking` appears in a streamed thinking summary the block is collapsed to a plain `Thinking...` placeholder and its signature is dropped so subsequent turns can't re-anchor on the garbled chain.
- Fixed Codex WebSocket silent stalls by adding protocol pings, inbound queue bounding, clearer idle-timeout diagnostics, and SDK retry clamping for first-event timeouts.

### Fixed

- Fixed Synthetic model discovery to treat the provider `/models` response as authoritative so deprecated bundled IDs are pruned from the runtime cache, and changed Synthetic login validation to avoid probing a specific model ([#1417](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1417)).

### Added

- Added `parseStreamingJsonThrottled` to `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai/utils/json-parse` — a per-delta wrapper around `parseStreamingJson` that skips re-parses until the buffer has grown by `minGrowthBytes` (default 256). Wired into the streaming hot path of every provider's tool-call argument accumulator (`anthropic`, `amazon-bedrock`, `openai-completions`, `openai-codex-responses`, `openai-responses-shared`) so per-delta cost is O(N) in total buffer length instead of O(N²). Each provider's `toolcall_end` still runs a final unthrottled parse, so the published `block.arguments` is unchanged.
- Added named-tool routing support to Google providers: `GoogleSharedStreamOptions.toolChoice` and `GoogleGeminiCliOptions.toolChoice` now accept `{ mode: "ANY"; allowedFunctionNames: [string, ...string[]] }` in addition to the string forms. `mapGoogleToolChoice` converts `ToolChoice` objects of shape `{ type: "tool" | "function", name }` to the wire form. Mirrors the equivalent Anthropic mapper.

### Changed

- Changed `mapGoogleToolChoice` to be exported from `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai/stream` so callers can build the wire-shape allow-list directly without re-deriving it.

## [15.5.0] - 2026-05-26
### Added

- Added `zhipu-coding-plan` provider for Zhipu (智谱) BigModel's domestic coding-plan SKU at `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/coding/paas/v4`, with dynamic model discovery (`ZHIPU_API_KEY`), zai-format thinking, `reasoning_content` field, and OAuth login flow ([#1340](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1340)).

### Removed

- Removed the `pi-ai` CLI binary (`packages/ai/src/cli.ts`) and its `bin` entry. Use the in-process equivalent in the omp coding-agent CLI: `omp auth-broker login [provider]`, `omp auth-broker logout [provider]`, and `omp auth-broker list`. The library API (`AuthStorage.login()`, `getOAuthProviders()`, etc.) is unchanged.

### Fixed

- Fixed delayed `toolResult` emissions so real tool results are emitted in the correct assistant `toolCall` window after handoff/compaction, preventing out-of-order or orphaned tool results
- Fixed delayed `toolResult` handling for aborted calls so a late real result is emitted instead of a synthetic `aborted` result for the same `toolCallId`
- Fixed usage polling to disable credentials when OAuth refresh fails definitively (for example `invalid_grant`) and clear cached last-good usage data so stale reports no longer remain visible

## [15.4.3] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- Fixed Google Vertex model discovery to use the project-scoped OpenAI-compatible model list so Vertex Model Garden models such as GLM and Claude are available through ADC auth ([#1412](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1412)).

## [15.4.2] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenCode Zen `big-pickle` follow-up requests replaying assistant tool-call turns without DeepSeek-required `reasoning_content`, which caused HTTP 400 errors in thinking mode.

## [15.4.1] - 2026-05-26
### Added

- Added `isOpenAICompletionsProgressChunk` export to identify real progress chunks vs. keepalives in OpenAI completions streams
- Added per-provider stream watchdog overrides via `getStreamIdleTimeoutMs(fallbackMs)` and `getStreamFirstEventTimeoutMs(idleTimeoutMs, fallbackMs)` to allow providers like Google Gemini CLI to extend first-event timeouts without affecting global defaults
- Added `promptCacheKey` to `StreamOptions` and passed it through stream option mapping so callers can specify an explicit prompt-cache key separate from `sessionId`
- Added `promptCacheKey` support to the native server option whitelist so `promptCacheKey` is accepted by `pi-native-server` streams
- Restored the per-provider stream watchdog (`iterateWithIdleTimeout`) on top of the abortable iterator. The lazy stream forwarder in `register-builtins` now wraps every provider's event stream with the first-event + steady-state idle watchdog (`PI_STREAM_FIRST_EVENT_TIMEOUT_MS`, `PI_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`; aliases honored), and Anthropic / OpenAI Completions / OpenAI Responses / Azure OpenAI Responses / Codex SSE re-emit their per-provider progress predicates so empty keepalive frames cannot keep a stalled stream alive. Reverts the partial regression from #1392 that left Codex WebSocket subagent runs hanging silently for hours when the broker dropped frames between deltas. The Codex WebSocket transport additionally now resets `lastProgressAt` only on progress events (not keepalives), giving the 300s WS-internal idle ceiling the same liveness semantics as the SSE path.

### Changed

- Enabled OpenAI Codex WebSocket streams to apply `streamIdleTimeoutMs` and `streamFirstEventTimeoutMs` from `StreamOptions` per request instead of fixed internal defaults
- Changed stream idle watchdog implementation from `iterateUntilAbort` to `iterateWithIdleTimeout`, which now enforces maximum idle gaps between streamed events and distinguishes between first-event and steady-state timeouts
- Changed Anthropic, OpenAI Responses, OpenAI Completions, Azure OpenAI Responses, and OpenAI Codex Responses providers to use the new idle-timeout iterator with per-provider progress predicates so empty keepalive frames cannot keep a stalled stream alive
- Changed Codex WebSocket transport to reset `lastProgressAt` only on progress events (not keepalives), giving the 300s WS-internal idle ceiling the same liveness semantics as the SSE path
- Changed Google Gemini CLI stream forwarding defaults to use a 5-minute first-event floor via per-provider lazy-stream limits to avoid premature first-event timeouts on slow startup
- Changed OpenAI Responses and OpenAI Codex request handling to keep `sessionId` for provider routing and conversation headers while `promptCacheKey` controls the `prompt_cache_key` payload independently
- Changed `StreamOptions.streamIdleTimeoutMs` documentation to clarify it is now wired into every built-in provider and the lazy stream forwarder, and that `streamFirstEventTimeoutMs` is honored at both the SDK-request layer and the iterator-watchdog layer
- Changed OpenAI Responses and OpenAI Codex request handling so `sessionId` continues to drive provider routing and state while `promptCacheKey` controls the `prompt_cache_key` payload
- Changed Google Gemini CLI stream forwarding defaults to use a 5-minute first-event floor to avoid premature first-event timeouts on slow startup
- Changed auth-gateway request mapping to preserve incoming `prompt_cache_key` as both `promptCacheKey` and `sessionId` when routing OpenAI-compatible sessions
- Un-deprecated `StreamOptions.streamIdleTimeoutMs`; the option is wired into every built-in provider and the lazy stream forwarder again. `streamFirstEventTimeoutMs` is now honored at both the SDK-request layer (via `createSdkStreamRequestOptions`) and the iterator-watchdog layer, in cooperation.

### Removed

- Removed `installH2Fetch` and the `fetch` patch that forced HTTP/2 on HTTPS requests; callers now use the default Bun `fetch` transport

### Fixed

- Fixed first-item timeout handling so `iterateWithIdleTimeout` no longer keeps first-event timers active after the source throws or the consumer stops before semantic progress
- Fixed silent multi-hour hangs on Codex WebSocket subagent runs when the broker dropped frames between deltas by restoring per-provider stream watchdogs with progress-event filtering
- Fixed z.ai/GLM-via-OpenRouter subagent stalls where no-op keepalive chunks reset the idle watchdog indefinitely by filtering non-progress items before resetting the deadline

## [15.4.0] - 2026-05-26
### Breaking Changes

- Removed `findAnthropicAuth` from `anthropic-auth` and replaced store-driven auth discovery with `buildAnthropicAuthConfig`, requiring callers to provide an already-resolved API key before building Anthropic auth config

### Added

- Added `PI_CODEX_WEBSOCKET_FIRST_EVENT_TIMEOUT_MS` and `PI_CODEX_WEBSOCKET_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` options to tune Codex WebSocket timeout behavior before fallback
- Added `AuthStorage.getOAuthAccess` to return a refreshed OAuth access token with identity metadata (`accountId`, `email`, `projectId`, `enterpriseUrl`) for callers that need bearer-token headers together
- Added Codex WebSocket forwarding to the `onSseEvent` observer so the raw provider-stream debug viewer captures the inbound JSON frames and the outbound request frame from the WS transport using the same synthesized SSE-wire shape (`event:` + `data:` lines, prefixed with a `: ws ← <type>` (inbound) or `: ws → <type>` (outbound) comment).

### Changed

- Changed OAuth selection in `AuthStorage` to treat credentials as stale when they are within 60 seconds of expiry and rotate them preemptively
- Changed Google Gemini CLI, Google Gemini usage, Antigravity usage, and Kimi usage flows to stop refreshing OAuth tokens directly and rely on `AuthStorage` for token rotation

### Deprecated

- Deprecated `streamIdleTimeoutMs` in `StreamOptions` as a compatibility-only field that is no longer used by providers

### Removed

- Removed provider-local OAuth refresh helpers from Google Gemini CLI and Google/Kimi/Antigravity usage probes, preventing direct refresh calls from those usage paths

### Fixed

- Dropped truncated, thinking-only assistant turns with only `thinking`/`redacted_thinking` blocks and no `text` or `tool` content during message transformation, preventing Anthropic requests from sending consecutive assistant messages after a `max_tokens`/`error`/`aborted` interruption
- Fixed Amazon Bedrock bearer-token authentication to honor `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK` before resolving AWS profiles or running `credential_process`, matching Bedrock API-key precedence. ([#1399](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1399))
- Updated `isRetryableError` to treat Bun HTTP/2 transport errors (`HTTP2StreamReset`, `HTTP2RefusedStream`) as retryable so transient stream-reset failures can be retried
- Fixed Codex WebSocket streaming to recover from stalled sessions by falling back to SSE when the first event or subsequent progress is delayed beyond the configured websocket timeout
- Fixed expired OAuth handling so provider-level paths no longer attempt direct token refresh calls for expired credentials and instead rely on `AuthStorage` for rotation
- Fixed provider streams aborting slow-but-valid first tokens or silent inter-event gaps with OMP-owned first-event/idle watchdog errors. Built-in lazy streams, OpenAI/Anthropic/Azure/Codex SSE, and Codex WebSocket streams now wait for provider output, provider/socket errors, caller aborts, or explicit request-layer timeouts instead of treating provider silence as failure ([#1392](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1392)).
- Fixed Claude Opus 4.7 on Amazon Bedrock streaming no reasoning output (and appearing to hang on long reasoning runs) because Anthropic silently switched the adaptive-thinking display default to `"omitted"`. The Bedrock provider now sends `thinking.display = "summarized"` by default on Opus 4.7+ adaptive models and on budget-based Claude models, mirroring the existing direct-Anthropic behavior. `BedrockOptions.thinkingDisplay` (`"summarized" | "omitted"`) is exposed for callers that want to opt out, and `hideThinkingSummary` now wires through to the Bedrock case ([#1373](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1373)).
- Fixed Cursor Composer resume/tool-continuation turns failing with `Cannot send empty user message to Cursor API`. Empty current user turns now use Cursor's `resumeAction` instead of constructing an invalid `userMessageAction` ([#1376](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1376)).
- Fixed `pi-ai login moonshot` failing with `invalid temperature: only 1 is allowed for this model` (HTTP 400) because the API-key validator probed `kimi-k2.5` with `temperature: 0`. Moonshot login now validates against `GET /v1/models`, matching the DeepSeek/Fireworks/NanoGPT/ZenMux pattern and authenticating the key without invoking model-specific parameter restrictions.

## [15.3.2] - 2026-05-25
### Added

- Added `GET /v1/snapshot/stream` for live auth-broker snapshot updates via SSE with `snapshot`, `entry`, and `removed` event frames
- Added `AuthBrokerClient.openSnapshotStream()` for consuming SSE snapshot streams from `/v1/snapshot/stream`
- Added `streamSnapshots` option to `RemoteAuthCredentialStore` (default `true`) to enable or disable SSE-based snapshot synchronization
- Added `streamKeepaliveMs` to `startAuthBroker()` to tune heartbeat frequency for the SSE stream
- Added `AuthStorage.checkCredentials({ signal?, timeoutMs?, baseUrlResolver? })` that returns a per-credential `CredentialHealthResult` with tri-state `ok` (`true` / `false` / `null`-unverifiable), the credential's identity (provider, type, email/accountId, broker-refresh flag), and the upstream error string when the probe fails. Iterates sequentially over `listAuthCredentials()`, exercises OAuth refresh on expiry, then calls the per-provider `UsageProvider.fetchUsage` without swallowing errors — so callers can identify which row in a multi-account broker is producing 401s instead of getting a silently-deduplicated `fetchUsageReports` list.
- Added `GET /v1/credentials/check` to `startAuthGateway()` that forwards to `AuthStorage.checkCredentials` and returns `{ generatedAt, credentials }`. Gated by the same bearer as the rest of the gateway.

### Changed

- Changed `RemoteAuthCredentialStore` to prefer SSE snapshot streaming and automatically fall back to long-polling when a broker returns 404 for `/v1/snapshot/stream`
- Changed snapshot write-refresh flow so `RemoteAuthCredentialStore` skips immediate `/v1/snapshot` refreshes when SSE streaming is active
- Changed broker SSE stream behavior to keep connections open with periodic keepalives and an increased server idle timeout

## [15.3.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- Added DeepSeek to the built-in API-key login provider catalog so `omp login deepseek` stores a reusable `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` credential for the bundled DeepSeek models.

### Fixed

- Fixed `openai-responses` requests intermittently 400ing with `No tool call found for function call output with call_id …` after an aborted turn or a locally-rejected tool call (e.g. argument-validation failure). `convertConversationMessages` now folds orphan `function_call_output` / `custom_tool_call_output` items — those whose matching `function_call` was wiped by an earlier `dt: false` snapshot splice or never landed in any persisted provider payload — into assistant text notes, preserving the payload while keeping the request grammatically valid ([#1351](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1351)).

## [15.2.4] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- Fixed ChatGPT Plus/Pro (Codex) OAuth login returning `Token exchange failed: 403` on Windows. When port 1455 was in use, the callback server silently fell back to a random port; OpenAI's authorization endpoint accepts any localhost redirect URI (loose validation), so the browser callback succeeds and shows "Authentication Successful", but the token endpoint rejects the non-registered port with 403. The `OpenAICodexOAuthFlow` now enforces a fixed `redirectUri` option so a busy port immediately surfaces as "port unavailable" instead of producing a confusing 403 ([#1277](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1277)).
- Improved `exchangeCodeForToken` error diagnostics: the 403 response body (`error` / `error_description` fields) is now included in the thrown message, matching the existing `refreshOpenAICodexToken` behaviour.

### Added

- Added `ChatGPT Plus/Pro (Codex, headless/device)` (`openai-codex-device`) as an alternative login method for the Codex provider. Uses OpenAI's device-code flow (`/api/accounts/deviceauth/usercode` → poll `/api/accounts/deviceauth/token`), which avoids a local callback server and port 1455 entirely. Credentials are stored under the existing `openai-codex` provider key so all models and tooling continue to work without reconfiguration ([#1277](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1277)).

## [15.2.2] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- Fixed `gemini-3.1-pro-high` and `gemini-3.1-pro-low` on the `google-antigravity` provider always returning HTTP 400 from Cloud Code Assist. The `ANTIGRAVITY_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION` identity header was not injected for these models because the internal check matched the string `"gemini-3-pro-high"` (hyphen) instead of the versioned `"gemini-3.1-pro-..."` form. The guard now matches all `gemini-3` model variants ([#1274](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1274)).

## [15.2.0] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- Fixed `/login` (and `/logout`, plus any `AuthStorage.set` / `remove` call) against a remote auth-broker throwing `RemoteAuthCredentialStore is read-only on the client. Use 'omp auth-broker login <provider>' to mutate credentials.` Added three optional async write hooks to `AuthCredentialStore` (`upsertAuthCredentialRemote`, `replaceAuthCredentialsRemote`, `deleteAuthCredentialsRemote`); `RemoteAuthCredentialStore` implements them via the broker's `POST /v1/credential` and `POST /v1/credential/:id/disable` endpoints and applies the broker's authoritative post-write entries to the local snapshot. `AuthStorage` routes through the hooks when present, so OAuth and API-key logins (and logouts) initiated from a broker-backed client now persist server-side and surface immediately without waiting for the long-poll snapshot tick.

## [15.1.9] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- Fixed Ollama named tool forcing to send only the requested tool when the caller passes a named `toolChoice`, preserving `tool_choice: "required"` while preventing local models from selecting a different tool. ([#1236](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1236))
- Fixed `/btw` (and IRC background replies) returning a `BedrockException` 400 (`The toolConfig field must be defined when using toolUse and toolResult content blocks.`) on LiteLLM → Bedrock once the session has tool-call history. Two source fixes in `buildParams`: (1) `if (context.tools)` → `if (context.tools?.length)` so an explicit `context.tools = []` (the /btw opt-out) never routes through `convertTools` and never emits an empty `"tools"` array; (2) `else if (hasToolHistory(...))` → `else if (context.tools === undefined && hasToolHistory(...))` so the Anthropic-proxy sentinel that injects `tools: []` for tool-history turns is suppressed when the caller explicitly opted out, preventing it from re-introducing the empty array. As defence-in-depth, `tool_choice: "none"` is also dropped when the resolved tools list is missing or empty. ([#1227](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1227))

## [15.1.8] - 2026-05-20
### Added

- Added Fireworks Fire Pass as a separate `firepass` provider with API-key login flow, bundled `kimi-k2.6-turbo` model entry (Kimi K2.6 Turbo), and wire-id translation from the friendly catalog id to the `accounts/fireworks/routers/kimi-k2p6-turbo` router endpoint. Fire Pass keys (`fpk_…`) authorize only the dedicated router and reject `/v1/models`, so login validation pings chat completions against the router id directly. Extended the openai-completions Kimi-family safety net so the firepass entry inherits the per-Fireworks-docs "always send `max_tokens`" default ([Kimi K2 guide](https://docs.fireworks.ai/models/kimi-k2)); the router's accepted `reasoning_effort` set includes `xhigh`, so it is forwarded verbatim rather than remapped. See https://docs.fireworks.ai/firepass.

### Fixed

- Fixed DeepSeek V4 direct API requests with tools to keep documented thinking mode instead of dropping reasoning: lower OMP efforts now map to DeepSeek's supported `high`, `tool_choice` is omitted, `thinking: { type: "enabled" }` and `max_tokens` are sent, and partial user `reasoningEffortMap` overrides merge with DeepSeek defaults. ([#1207](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1207))
- Fixed model cache schema v2 databases so offline refreshes preserve cached provider discoveries after upgrading to schema v3 and subsequent online refreshes can overwrite the cache. ([#1219](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1219))
- Fixed Perplexity OAuth credentials being treated as expired one hour after login. `getJwtExpiry` was fabricating `expires = now + 1h` whenever the JWT had no `exp` claim (the common case — Perplexity sessions are server-side). Once the hour elapsed, `getOAuthApiKey` would mark the cred expired and the search provider's loader would silently skip it, surfacing as "logged out". Logins with no `exp` now persist a far-future sentinel; `getOAuthApiKey` also normalizes any stale `expires` written by older builds.

## [15.1.7] - 2026-05-19
### Added

- Added Anthropic realization of `serviceTier: "priority"`. The anthropic-messages provider now sets `speed: "fast"` on the request and appends the `fast-mode-2026-02-01` beta to `Anthropic-Beta` whenever the caller passes `serviceTier: "priority"`. When the server rejects an unsupported model with `invalid_request_error`, the provider transparently retries the same turn without the fast-mode signal (mirroring the strict-tools fallback pattern), persists the disable via a new `providerSessionState.fastModeDisabled` flag so subsequent requests in the session skip the field, and surfaces the action via the new `AssistantMessage.disabledFeatures` array (id `"priority"`) so callers can sync user-facing toggles. A new `clearAnthropicFastModeFallback(providerSessionState)` helper lets callers re-arm priority after the auto-fallback fired.
- Added scoped `ServiceTier` values: `"openai-only"` (priority on `openai`/`openai-codex`, ignored elsewhere) and `"claude-only"` (priority on direct `anthropic`, ignored on Bedrock/Vertex Claude and elsewhere). A new `resolveServiceTier(serviceTier, provider)` helper computes the effective tier for the provider; existing OpenAI/Anthropic provider code routes through it, so `service_tier` and Anthropic fast-mode emission both respect scope. `getPriorityPremiumRequests` now counts Anthropic+priority as one premium request (previously zero) and continues to ignore providers that drop the field on the wire.

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic fast mode (`serviceTier: "priority"`) looping on 429 `rate_limit_error: "Extra usage is required for fast mode."` for accounts without the extra-usage entitlement. `isAnthropicFastModeUnsupportedError` now matches the 429 phrasing in addition to the 400 `invalid_request_error` "does not support the `speed` parameter" case, so the provider drops `speed: "fast"` on the in-turn retry, sets `providerSessionState.fastModeDisabled` for the remainder of the session, and surfaces `disabledFeatures: ["priority"]` to the caller instead of retrying with the same payload until `PROVIDER_MAX_RETRIES` is exhausted.
- Fixed MiniMax Coding Plan CN streaming `<think>...</think>` reasoning as visible assistant text. The OpenAI-compatible stream parser now enables the existing MiniMax tag parser for both `minimax-code` and `minimax-code-cn`, so CN responses become structured `thinking` blocks instead of raw text. ([#1203](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1203))

## [15.1.6] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- Fixed `{}` (empty JSON Schema, the wire representation of `z.unknown()`) being passed verbatim to grammar-constrained samplers (llama.cpp, etc.) in `additionalProperties`, `items`, and other schema-valued positions across **every provider** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama, Bedrock, Cursor). Grammar builders treat `{}` as "generate an empty object" rather than "any JSON value", causing open-typed fields (e.g. `extra.title` from `z.record(z.string(), z.unknown())`) to always emit `{}` instead of the intended string/number/etc. `toolWireSchema` now applies a new `normalizeEmptySchemas` pass (exported) to both the Zod and TypeBox/raw-JSON-Schema branches, converting `{}` → `true` (semantically identical per JSON Schema draft 2020-12 §4.3.1) in all schema-valued positions. Strict-mode opt-out is preserved across all providers: OpenAI's `hasUnrepresentableStrictObjectMap` hits the `=== true` branch instead of the `isJsonObject({})` branch (same result); Anthropic's `normalizeAnthropicStrictSchemaNode` opts out via `additionalProperties !== false` (still true for `true`); Google's `normalizeSchemaForGoogle` strips `additionalProperties` regardless (pre-existing). ([#1179](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1179))
- Fixed `pi-ai login <provider>` crashing with `Unknown provider` for providers that only the `auth-storage` `login()` switch knew about (perplexity, alibaba-coding-plan, gitlab-duo, huggingface, opencode-zen/go, lm-studio, ollama, cerebras, fireworks, qianfan, synthetic, venice, litellm, moonshot, together, cloudflare/vercel ai gateways, vllm, qwen-portal, nvidia, xiaomi, and any custom OAuth provider). The CLI now delegates to `SqliteAuthCredentialStore.login()` instead of duplicating a smaller switch, so the auth-broker `omp auth-broker login <provider>` flow works for every registered OAuth provider.

## [15.1.4] - 2026-05-19
### Changed

- Updated auth-gateway format and pi-native request handling to invalidate the failed API key and retry the provider request with a replacement key when authentication fails

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenCode-Go and OpenCode-Zen chat-completions replay to omit stored reasoning fields on Kimi assistant tool-call messages, avoiding provider 400s for rejected `messages[].reasoning` payloads. ([#1157](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1157))
- Fixed OpenAI Responses and Codex tool schema normalization to emit `properties: {}` for no-argument object schemas without rewriting literal payloads. ([#1147](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1147))
- Fixed Anthropic 400 (`unexpected tool_use_id found in tool_result blocks ... Each tool_result block must have a corresponding tool_use block in the previous message`) when handoff/compaction folds an assistant `tool_use` into the handoff summary string but leaves the matching user-side `tool_result` message in the history. `transformMessages` now indexes every `tool_use` id surviving the first pass and drops orphan `tool_result` messages whose originator was compacted away, preserving the text payload as a user-level `<stale-tool-result>` note so the model still sees what the tool returned. The note is emitted with `role: "user"` rather than `role: "developer"` so providers that elevate developer-role messages (Ollama: `developer` → `system`; OpenAI chat-completions reasoning models: `developer` → `developer`) cannot lift stale tool output to an instruction-priority tier above the surrounding user/developer messages.
- Fixed streaming authentication retry to trigger when a provider emits a 401 `error` event after a `start` event but before any replay-unsafe content is emitted
- Added `credential_process` support to the Bedrock provider's AWS credential resolver so profiles delegating to external brokers (`aws-vault`, `granted`, in-house tools) resolve instead of falling through to `Unable to resolve AWS credentials`. Parses the AWS SDK `Version: 1` JSON envelope, honors `Expiration` in the per-profile cache, propagates `AbortSignal` to the spawned helper, routes Windows `.cmd`/`.bat` helpers through `cmd.exe /c`, and ships a POSIX-shell-style tokenizer that preserves backslashes inside double quotes so Windows paths survive ([#1142](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1142))

## [15.1.3] - 2026-05-17
### Breaking Changes

- Changed `AuthBrokerClient.fetchSnapshot()` to return status-based results (`200` or `304`) instead of always returning a raw snapshot body, so callers now need to branch on `status`
- Renamed public schema utilities in `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai/utils/schema` by replacing `sanitizeSchemaForGoogle`, `sanitizeSchemaForCCA`, `prepareSchemaForCCA`, and `sanitizeSchemaForMCP` with `normalizeSchemaForGoogle`, `normalizeSchemaForCCA`, and `normalizeSchemaForMCP`
- Added MCP schema normalization via `normalizeSchemaForMCP` for compatibility checks
- Removed the `StringEnum` helper from `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai/utils/schema`. Use `z.enum([...])` directly; Zod's emitted JSON Schema is already wire-compatible with Google and other providers.
- Renamed the concrete SQLite credential store class from `AuthCredentialStore` to `SqliteAuthCredentialStore`. `AuthCredentialStore` is now the persistence interface implemented by both the SQLite store and the new `RemoteAuthCredentialStore`. Update `new AuthCredentialStore(db)` / `AuthCredentialStore.open(...)` call-sites to `SqliteAuthCredentialStore`; type-position uses (`store: AuthCredentialStore`) continue to work unchanged.

### Added

- Added `onAuthError` to `StreamOptions` and wired `streamSimple()` to retry once with a replacement API key when the first provider response is a 401 before any assistant events are emitted
- Added generation-aware snapshot metadata (`generation`, `serverNowMs`, `refresher`, and `rotatesInMs`) to auth-broker snapshot responses to support client-side credential-rotation planning
- Added `transport: "pi-native"` on `Model` and the matching `streamPiNative` client. When `model.transport === "pi-native"`, `streamSimple` short-circuits the per-provider dispatch and POSTs the canonical `Context` to the auth-gateway's `POST /v1/pi/stream` endpoint. The response is SSE-framed `AssistantMessageEvent`s parsed by `readSseJson` and pushed verbatim into the local `AssistantMessageEventStream` — no wire-format translation, no partial-stripping reconstruction. Used by containerized omp installs (robomp slots, swarm extension, etc.) to route every LLM call through a credential-holding sidecar; the slot itself never sees the real provider tokens. Server-controlled fields (`apiKey`, `signal`, `fetch`, lifecycle callbacks, the provider-session map) are stripped from the wire body — `apiKey` rides in the `Authorization` header as the gateway bearer.
- Added `POST /v1/pi/stream` to the auth-gateway. Same auth + abort + model-resolution + codex-compat + prefix-cache plumbing as the foreign-wire routes; only the wire-format translation is skipped. Request body is `{ modelId, context, options?, stream? }` where `context` is the canonical pi-ai `Context` and `options` is `SimpleStreamOptions` with non-serializable fields stripped. Response is SSE-framed `AssistantMessageEvent` (terminated by `data: [DONE]`) when streaming, or `{ message: AssistantMessage }` JSON when `stream: false`.
- Added Vertex AI authentication via Google Application Default Credentials from `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`, or metadata server tokens, with token caching and refresh skew control via `GOOGLE_VERTEX_REFRESH_SKEW_MS`
- Added support for Anthropic image message parts with `type: "url"` and `type: "file"` sources
- Added `stopSequences` and `frequencyPenalty` to shared stream options and wired them through to OpenAI request translation
- Added optional request cancellation support to auth-broker interactions by propagating `AbortSignal` into health, snapshot, usage, and refresh calls
- Added `AuthStorage.setConfigApiKey` / `removeConfigApiKey` / `clearConfigApiKeys` for config-sourced per-provider bearers (e.g. `models.yml` `providers.<name>.apiKey`). The new tier sits between runtime `--api-key` and stored credentials in `getApiKey`/`peekApiKey` resolution, so a bearer pinned in config now beats the broker's OAuth access token. Also suppresses OAuth `account_uuid` attribution when active, since outbound auth is the explicit config bearer, not OAuth. `describeCredentialSource` reports `"config override (models.yml)"` for visibility.
- Added per-model `additional_rate_limits` parsing to `openaiCodexUsageProvider`. The Codex `wham/usage` endpoint surfaces a separate `GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark` rate limit (`metered_feature: codex_bengalfox`) on Pro accounts; these now emit dedicated `openai-codex:spark:{primary,secondary}` `UsageLimit` entries with `scope.tier = "spark"`, mirroring how Anthropic exposes `anthropic:7d:sonnet` separately from the umbrella `anthropic:7d` bucket. The osx-widgets client already keyed spark detection off `limit.id.includes("spark")`; this populates that contract end-to-end.
- Added `GET /v1/usage` to the auth-broker API to expose aggregated usage reports from `AuthStorage.fetchUsageReports`
- Added auth-broker usage polling response handling that returns normalized usage reports plus generation timestamp for clients (5-min per-credential cache via `AuthStorage`)
- Added the auth-broker subsystem (`@oh-my-pi/pi-ai/auth-broker`) for sharing OAuth credentials across machines without leaking refresh tokens.
- `startAuthBroker(...)` boots a `Bun.serve` HTTP server exposing `GET /v1/healthz`, `GET /v1/snapshot`, `POST /v1/credential` (upsert), `POST /v1/credential/:id/refresh`, and `POST /v1/credential/:id/disable`.
- `AuthBrokerClient` is the matching HTTP client used by remote clients.
- `RemoteAuthCredentialStore` is a client-side `AuthCredentialStore` that mirrors a broker snapshot in memory; mutating methods (`replace*`, `upsert*`, `delete*ForProvider`) throw because writes are server-side only.
- `AuthBrokerRefresher` is the background refresh loop that pre-refreshes credentials within `refreshSkewMs` and disables on definitive failure (`invalid_grant` / non-network 401-403).
- Added `AuthStorage.exportSnapshot()`, `AuthStorage.upsertCredential(provider, credential)`, `AuthStorage.forceRefreshCredentialById(id)`, and `AuthStorage.disableCredentialById(id, cause)` public methods consumed by the auth-broker server.
- Added `AuthStorageOptions.refreshOAuthCredential` override so a remote-store client can route every OAuth refresh through the broker instead of the local OAuth endpoint.
- Added `REMOTE_REFRESH_SENTINEL` (`"__remote__"`) — the wire placeholder substituted for OAuth refresh tokens in broker snapshots; clients never see the real refresh token.
- Exposed the OAuth provider catalog (`getOAuthProviders`, `OAuthProvider`, `OAuthProviderInfo`) and `refreshOAuthToken` through the package barrel so the coding-agent CLI can target them without reaching into `utils/oauth`.
- Added the auth-gateway subsystem (`@oh-my-pi/pi-ai/auth-gateway`) — a forward-proxy that sits between unauthenticated clients (the macOS usage widget, llm-git, robomp containers, …) and the broker. Clients send standard provider-format requests; the gateway parses them into omp's canonical `Context`, dispatches through pi-ai's `streamSimple()`, and translates the canonical event stream back to the matching wire format. `Authorization` is injected server-side so access tokens never leave the gateway host. Wire surface:
- `GET  /healthz` — unauth liveness.
- `GET  /v1/usage` — aggregated provider usage; 5-min per-credential cache via `AuthStorage.fetchUsageReports`.
- `GET  /v1/models` — model catalog (scoped to providers with credentials).
- `POST /v1/chat/completions` — OpenAI chat-completions in/out.
- `POST /v1/messages` — Anthropic messages in/out (text + thinking + tool_use blocks, SSE event taxonomy preserved).
- `POST /v1/responses` — OpenAI Responses in/out (reasoning items + function_call output items, SSE pass-through).
- Added exports from `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai/auth-gateway`: `startAuthGateway`, `AuthGatewayServerOptions`, `AuthGatewayBootOptions`, `AuthGatewayServerHandle`, `ModelResolver`, `DEFAULT_AUTH_GATEWAY_BIND`. Per-format `parseRequest` / `encodeResponse` / `encodeStream` triples are reachable via the `./providers/*` subpath as `openai-chat-server`, `anthropic-messages-server`, and `openai-responses-server`.
- Added `listProvidersWithEnvKey()` to enumerate every provider with an env-var fallback (used by the new migrate command in coding-agent).

### Changed

- Changed `GET /v1/snapshot` to support generation-based polling with `If-None-Match` and `wait` for long-poll updates and to return `304` when no snapshot changes are available
- Changed Bedrock credential resolution for streaming calls to prefer environment keys, AWS profile/SSO credentials, and IMDSv2 fallback when available
- Changed auth-gateway parsing for OpenAI chat-completions and Responses to ignore unsupported SDK-only fields instead of rejecting requests
- Changed auth-gateway protocol handling to include CORS headers on responses and support browser-origin requests
- Changed prompt-cache handling to resolve cache keys from request metadata and headers and preserve them through protocol translation
- Changed Anthropic messages parsing to forward request `metadata` through to downstream execution
- Changed usage report caching to use a 5-minute per-credential TTL with jittered refresh timing to reduce usage endpoint rate-limit collisions
- Changed usage polling failure handling so transient errors continue serving the last known report instead of returning null and dropping the credential from usage aggregates after cache expiry
- Changed `sanitizeSchemaForGoogle` to normalize snake_case schema keys (such as `any_of` and `additional_properties`) to camelCase and auto-generate `propertyOrdering` for multi-property objects
- Changed strict-mode sanitization to resolve `$ref` nodes with sibling keys by inlining and merging referenced local definitions
- Changed strict-mode sanitization to flatten single-entry `allOf` nodes and remove the `allOf` wrapper
- Changed Anthropic tool schema normalization to preserve supported metadata keywords such as `$ref`, `$defs`, `$schema`, `enum`, `const`, `default`, `title`, and `nullable` instead of stripping them
- Changed string schema processing to retain only supported `format` values (`date-time`, `time`, `date`, `duration`, `email`, `hostname`, `uri`, `ipv4`, `ipv6`, `uuid`) and demote unsupported `format` values to `description` hints

### Fixed

- Fixed OAuth credential refresh flow so concurrent manual and background refreshes now share one in-flight attempt per credential, and `RemoteAuthCredentialStore` now re-synchronizes before using near-expiring OAuth credentials
- Fixed stale-credential handling after auth failures by waiting for updated broker snapshots and refreshing suspect credentials through broker endpoints before continuing
- Fixed Google Generative AI startup behavior to throw a clear API-key-required error when no key is configured
- Fixed AWS Bedrock image message serialization to preserve base64 `source.bytes` payloads instead of decoding and rebuilding them
- Fixed Google provider error handling to extract the API-reported `error.message` from JSON response bodies when available
- Fixed `RemoteAuthCredentialStore.getUsageReport` to return the matching credential-specific usage report and coalesce parallel callers into one broker `/v1/usage` fetch
- Fixed auth-broker credential upload validation to reject the remote refresh-token sentinel and prevent storing a non-refresh value
- Fixed OpenAI Responses streaming output to emit `reasoning_summary_text` events and parse/send `summary_text` reasoning payloads
- Fixed Anthropic stop-sequence handling by trimming requests to the API limit of four entries before forwarding
- Fixed prompt caching behavior across protocol translations so cached-token usage is preserved when Anthropic and OpenAI requests are routed through each other
- Fixed Claude usage fetching to retry transient `429` and `5xx` responses with exponential backoff, respecting `Retry-After` before returning failure
- Fixed auth-gateway request translation to preserve OpenAI Responses string/system message content, reasoning replay payloads, completed item text in stream item-done events, Anthropic tool-result ordering, and OpenAI Chat/Responses cached-token usage totals
- Fixed auth-gateway failure handling so unsupported request controls, upstream terminal errors, non-streaming aborts, and already-aborted client requests fail explicitly instead of being accepted, ignored, or encoded as successful HTTP 200 responses
- Fixed Gemini CLI / Antigravity tool schema normalization to run the full Cloud Code Assist pipeline, matching shared Google schema handling for union/object merging and nullable extraction
- Fixed stripped validation hints to be preserved as description spill text (`{key: value}` blocks) when `normalizeSchemaForGoogle` and `normalizeSchemaForCCA` drop unsupported schema keywords
- Fixed `sanitizeSchemaForGoogle` to collapse nullability forms (`type:'null'` and null-bearing `anyOf` variants) into `nullable` while preserving remaining variants
- Fixed `sanitizeSchemaForGoogle` to inline local `$defs` references instead of dropping `$ref`/`$defs` structure during Google schema sanitization
- Fixed `normalizeAnthropicToolSchema` to handle self-referential schemas without infinite recursion
- Fixed object schema normalization so explicit open-map declarations (`additionalProperties: true` and schema-valued `additionalProperties`) are preserved instead of being converted to closed objects
- Fixed unsupported schema constraints on arrays and strings (`maxItems`, `uniqueItems`, `pattern`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, and `minItems` when greater than 1) by demoting them into `description` rather than dropping them

### Security

- Hardened auth-gateway bearer-token checks with constant-time comparison to avoid timing-side-channel leaks

## [15.1.2] - 2026-05-15
### Breaking Changes

- Rejected draft-07 tuple and dependency keywords (`items` arrays, `dependencies`, `additionalItems`) in JSON Schema validation

### Added

- Added `responseHeaders`, `responseStatus`, and `responseRequestId` fields to `MockResponse` so mock providers can provide synthetic `ProviderResponseMetadata`
- Added `onResponse` metadata emission for mocks that sends lowercased headers and a default status of 200 before streaming when response headers are configured
- Added recursive strict-mode sanitization for array `prefixItems` entries so tuple schemas now enforce object constraints per item

### Changed

- Normalized legacy draft-07 JSON Schema constructs used in tool parameters (`items` arrays, `additionalItems`, `definitions`, `dependencies`) to draft 2020-12 before OpenAI/Google/CCA sanitization, wire conversion, and argument validation
- Reworked OpenAI response schema adaptation to rewrite `oneOf` into `anyOf` while preserving existing `anyOf` branches
- Changed tuple array validation to validate per-index schemas from `prefixItems` and apply `items` only to remaining elements

### Fixed

- Fixed validation of plain JSON Schema tool arguments that omitted a `$schema` URI so draft-07-shaped schemas now pass validation instead of being rejected
- Fixed tuple-array validation for legacy JSON Schema tool schemas to enforce `additionalItems: false` and per-position constraints after automatic draft upgrade
- Fixed Anthropic tool schema normalization to recurse into `prefixItems` so unsupported constraints inside tuple items are stripped in the generated input schema
- Fixed Anthropic tool-schema normalization stripping the body of explicit open `additionalProperties` (e.g. Zod's `z.record(z.string(), z.unknown())` compiling to `additionalProperties: {}`) by unconditionally overwriting it with `false`, which closed record-style fields and prevented models from supplying any key. The coding-agent's `resolve` tool exposes plan-approval titles via such a field, so Kimi K2 (and any other Anthropic-shaped provider) could not pass `extra: { title }`, blocking plan mode entirely ([#1104](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1104))
- Fixed Anthropic strict tool planning to leave tools with open `additionalProperties` maps non-strict instead of sending schemas Anthropic rejects.

## [15.1.0] - 2026-05-15

### Breaking Changes

- Removed TypeBox root exports (`Type`, `Static`, and `TSchema`) from the package entrypoint, so callers importing those symbols from `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai` must migrate to `zod` or `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai/types`

### Added

- Added support for defining tool schemas with Zod (`z.object`, `z.string`, etc.) by allowing `Tool.parameters` to be either Zod schemas or legacy JSON Schema objects and converting them to provider wire format automatically
- Added package-level schema helpers in the `zod/v4` style by exporting `z` and `ZodType` from the root entrypoint
- Added a `mock` API provider via `createMockModel` to build `Model<"mock">` instances for fully in-memory, deterministic assistant streams in tests
- Added `streamMock` and `registerMockApi` so mock responses can be consumed through `stream()` and the global custom API registry without an external model backend
- Added async/sync response scripting with optional context-based handlers, and new `push()`/`reset()` controls to drive multi-turn mock interactions and inspect per-call invocation state
- Added support in mock responses for simulating tool calls, usage metadata, custom stop reasons, delayed emissions, and terminal error/aborted outcomes

### Changed

- Changed Azure OpenAI Responses tool schema conversion to sanitize tool parameter schemas and rewrite `oneOf` branches as `anyOf` so tool calls remain compatible with Azure's schema expectations
- Changed `Static<S>` to extract a schema object’s `static` type when present, improving inferred tool argument types for non-Zod parameter definitions
- Changed `Static` typing behavior so it now infers argument types from Zod schemas and defaults to `unknown` for non-Zod JSON Schema parameter definitions
- Restored the default steady-state stream idle timeout to 120s (regressed in 15.0.0). 30s was too aggressive for reasoning models, slow proxies, and tool-call planning gaps, surfacing as repeated `Provider stream stalled while waiting for the next event` errors. Existing `PI_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` / `PI_OPENAI_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` overrides are unchanged.

### Fixed

- Preserved top-level unknown fields in validated tool-call arguments so extra root properties are retained after schema coercion
- Fixed coercion for Zod `record` fields by parsing JSON-stringified record arguments into objects
- Validated legacy draft-07 JSON Schema tool parameters directly instead of converting through Zod, improving support for features like `$ref`, `definitions`, `nullable`, and `uniqueItems`
- Fixed Cloud Code Assist schema preparation to strip unsupported `propertyNames` and fall back to a minimal tool schema when schema meta-validation detects malformed keywords
- Fixed OpenAI Completions streaming to avoid treating non-output chunks (including role-only preambles) as progress events so idle-timeout watchdog behavior no longer hangs on no-op streamed chunks
- Fixed Cloud Code Assist schema compatibility checks by replacing strict AJV meta-schema validation with structural JSON Schema validation to avoid rejecting structurally valid tool schemas
- Fixed lazy built-in provider streams (`anthropic-messages`, `bedrock-converse-stream`, `cursor-agent`, `google-*`, `ollama-chat`, `openai-*`) prematurely aborting slow first-token responses with `Provider stream stalled while waiting for the next event`. The lazy-stream watchdog wrapper was treating the synthetic `start` event (yielded immediately by every provider before the model emits any tokens) as the first real item, which caused the watchdog to drop from `firstItemTimeoutMs` (100s) to `idleTimeoutMs` (30s) before the upstream model had produced anything. The shared `iterateWithIdleTimeout` now keeps `awaitingFirstItem` true until a real progress item arrives, and the lazy-stream wrapper marks `start` as a non-progress keepalive ([#1073](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/1073) regression).
- Heal leaked Kimi K2 chat-template tool-call tokens (`<|tool_calls_section_begin|>` … `<|tool_call_argument_begin|>` … `<|tool_calls_section_end|>`) that some hosts (native `kimi-code` API, OpenRouter, Fireworks, etc.) emit into `delta.content` instead of structured `tool_calls`. The OpenAI-completions stream consumer now strips the markers from visible text, reconstructs the embedded calls as proper `toolCall` content blocks (stream-aware, token-boundary-safe), and promotes `finish_reason: stop` to `toolUse` when calls were healed.
- Fixed OpenAI-completions Kimi K2 healed-call promotion clobbering non-stop terminal finish reasons (`error`, `length`, `aborted`); promotion now only fires when the prior stop reason is the natural-completion `stop`
- Fixed OpenAI-completions duplicate Kimi tool calls when a single chunk delivers both leaked markers and a structured `delta.tool_calls`; the healer now strips visible markers but discards its synthesized calls so structured payloads remain the single source of truth
- Fixed Kimi tool-call healer synthesizing a bogus empty call when assistant text mentions a literal `<|tool_call_end|>` (or `<|tool_call_begin|>` / `<|tool_call_argument_begin|>`) outside an active `<|tool_calls_section_begin|>…<|tool_calls_section_end|>` section; the tokens now survive as text
- Fixed OpenAI-completions ignoring per-request `StreamOptions.streamFirstEventTimeoutMs` when configuring the underlying OpenAI SDK HTTP timeout, causing slow-before-headers providers to be aborted at the env default before the wrapping watchdog armed
- Fixed JSON Schema validator silently accepting values that violate `propertyNames`, `patternProperties`, `dependentRequired`, `dependencies`, `if`/`then`/`else`, `contains`, and `prefixItems`; the in-tree validator now enforces these keywords instead of falling through. `unevaluatedProperties`/`unevaluatedItems` remain permissive but log a one-time warning so tool authors are not surprised.
- Fixed recursive `$ref` schemas being treated as universally valid: the validator previously short-circuited on the second occurrence of any ref it had already seen, so nested values violating the referenced sub-schema passed. Cycle detection now keys on (ref, value-identity) pairs with a depth cap for primitive values, so genuine sub-tree violations are still caught.
- Fixed JSON Schema meta-validator accepting malformed `if`/`then`/`else` and `dependencies` keywords; each conditional sub-schema is now structurally validated and draft-07 `dependencies` accepts either a schema or a string array of dependent keys.
- Fixed Zod-emitted wire schemas dropping null-valued unknown root fields before `preserveUnknownRootFields` could snapshot them, so callers like `task.simple` no longer lose a `schema: null` argument and downstream rejection paths fire as intended.
- Fixed mock provider partial `Usage` to recompute `totalTokens` (and `cost.total` when cost components are supplied) when omitted, instead of reporting 0
- Fixed mock provider auto-generated tool-call IDs to use a per-instance counter (now reset by `reset()`), so test order no longer affects IDs across `createMockModel()` instances

## [15.0.2] - 2026-05-15
### Fixed

- Fixed `StreamOptions.fetch` typing to accept fetch-compatible override functions that do not expose `preconnect`, allowing custom fetch implementations to be used without type errors across runtimes
- Fixed Moonshot Kimi K2.6 forced tool calls to send `thinking: { type: "disabled" }`, avoiding `tool_choice 'specified' is incompatible with thinking enabled` 400s while preserving the requested named tool ([#1077](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1077)).

## [15.0.1] - 2026-05-14
### Breaking Changes

- Increased the minimum Bun runtime version to `>=1.3.14` for the `@aws-?` package

### Added

- Added `installH2Fetch` to patch `globalThis.fetch` so HTTPS requests attempt HTTP/2 over ALPN with automatic HTTP/1.1 fallback when HTTP/2 is unsupported
- Added priority service-tier traffic to the `premiumRequests` accounting on OpenAI and OpenAI Codex providers. Sending `serviceTier: "priority"` now increments `usage.premiumRequests` by 1 per request, matching the existing GitHub Copilot premium-request budget semantics so downstream consumers (e.g. the `omp stats` "Premium Reqs" card and `/usage`) reflect priority traffic alongside Copilot premium calls.

## [15.0.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- Added `AuthStorage.onCredentialDisabled(listener)` — a multi-subscriber `on/off` API for `credential_disabled` events. Returns an unsubscribe function; calling it more than once is a no-op. Multiple subscribers all receive every disable event, with synchronous and async exceptions isolated per-listener so a misbehaving subscriber cannot starve the rest of the chain. Buffer-and-replay semantics are preserved: events emitted while no listener is subscribed are buffered (FIFO, capped at 32) and replayed once to the listener that triggers the empty→non-empty transition. After every subscriber unsubscribes, subsequent disable events buffer again until the next subscribe.

### Fixed

- Fixed OAuth credentials being silently disabled when two omp processes (or any two `AuthStorage` instances sharing a `agent.db`) race on token refresh. Anthropic rotates refresh tokens on every use, so the loser's `invalid_grant` response previously soft-deleted the row that the winner just rotated, forcing the user to `/login` again. `#tryOAuthCredential` now re-reads the row from disk before declaring a definitive failure: if the persisted `refresh` differs from the snapshot it tried, the peer-rotated credential is reloaded and the request retries against the fresh token instead of disabling the live row.
- Closed a remaining race window in OAuth refresh-failure handling: between re-reading the credential row to check for peer rotation and the subsequent soft-delete, another process could still complete a refresh and rotate the row, leaving us to disable the freshly-rotated credential by `id`. The disable now runs as a single CAS update conditioned on the row's `data` still matching the snapshot we tried to refresh, and on `disabled_cause IS NULL`. If the CAS reports 0 rows changed (peer rotation, or row already disabled by a concurrent failure on the same snapshot), we reload from disk and retry instead of mutating the wrong row or emitting a spurious `credential_disabled` event.
### Changed
- Lowered the default steady-state stream idle timeout from 120s to 30s while preserving the existing environment overrides.

### Fixed
- Lazy built-in provider streams now enforce the shared idle watchdog and abort stalled provider requests, so session auto-retry can continue after transient network drops instead of remaining stuck. Caller aborts still terminate as aborted.

## [14.9.3] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- Anthropic provider now retries generic transient connect failures (`unable to connect`, `fetch failed`, `connection error`, etc.) by falling back to the shared `isRetryableError` allowlist after the provider-specific patterns. Previously these errors bypassed the hand-curated regex in `isProviderRetryableError` and aborted the stream on the first attempt, while the OpenAI SDK and Codex `fetchWithRetry` paths already handled them.

## [14.9.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added

### Fixed
- Fixed silent forwarding of image content (for example Python plot output rendered in the terminal) to models without vision support, which produced opaque 404 errors from upstream. Image blocks are now stripped and replaced with a `[image omitted: model does not support vision]` placeholder for non-vision models, including tool-result payloads ([#967](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/967), [#968](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/968)).

- Added `AuthStorage` `onCredentialDisabled` callback (sync or async) so embedders can react when a credential is automatically disabled (e.g. OAuth refresh fails with `invalid_grant`) — useful for surfacing a banner or auto-launching a re-login flow instead of letting the credential silently disappear. Sync throws and async rejections are both caught and logged so a misbehaving subscriber cannot break the disable path.
- Added Anthropic OAuth `account.uuid` and `account.email_address` extraction from the `/v1/oauth/token` exchange and refresh responses; both `AnthropicOAuthFlow.exchangeToken()` and `refreshAnthropicToken()` now populate `OAuthCredentials.{accountId, email}` so downstream consumers can attribute requests to the authenticated account without a separate `/api/oauth/profile` round-trip.
- Added `onSseEvent` stream diagnostics so HTTP SSE providers can expose raw SSE frames without changing parsed model output.
- Added `streamIdleTimeoutMs` option (and `PI_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` env override; `PI_OPENAI_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` remains a backward-compatible alias) for a steady-state inter-event watchdog. Set to `0` to disable.
- Added a semantic-progress predicate to OpenAI Responses and Codex SSE/WebSocket transports so `response.in_progress`-style keepalives no longer reset the idle deadline on stalled tool calls.

### Changed

- Anthropic streams now enforce a steady-state idle timeout (defaults to 120s, same control as `PI_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`) in addition to the first-event watchdog. Long-running responses that go fully silent between events will now surface as `Anthropic stream stalled while waiting for the next event` instead of hanging.
- Fixed `resolveAnthropicMetadataUserId()` to accept JSON-format `user_id` values that match real Claude Code's payload shape (`{ device_id, account_uuid, session_id, ... }` from `services/api/claude.ts:getAPIMetadata`). Previously only the synthetic `user_<hex>_account_<uuid>_session_<uuid>` cloaking format was accepted on OAuth, which caused stable session-keyed metadata supplied by callers to be discarded and replaced with fresh random entropy on every request — defeating session-count attribution on the Claude OAuth path.

## [14.8.0] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- Fixed Gemini 3 Pro thinking metadata so `medium` effort is rejected with the expected error instead of being silently accepted: `ThinkingConfig` now carries an optional explicit `levels` list that survives `expandEffortRange`, letting non-contiguous supported sets (e.g. `[low, high]`) round-trip through enrichment.
- Fixed Kimi Code OAuth expiry handling to refresh access tokens 5 minutes before server expiry, avoiding daily 401s from using tokens right up to the cutoff.
- Fixed OpenAI Responses custom tool replay to preserve custom tool call item IDs with the `ctc_` prefix instead of rewriting them as `fc_` function-call IDs ([#977](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/977)).

## [14.7.6] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Added `hideThinkingSummary` option to `SimpleStreamOptions`. When true, `streamSimple` requests that the underlying provider omit reasoning/thinking summaries: Anthropic receives `thinking.display = "omitted"` (where supported), and OpenAI Responses / Azure / Codex providers leave `reasoning.summary` unset so the server skips emitting the human-readable summary stream entirely.

### Changed

- Changed OpenAI Responses, Azure OpenAI Responses, and OpenAI Codex providers to omit `reasoning.summary` from requests when `reasoningSummary` is explicitly `null` (previously fell back to `"auto"`).
## [14.7.5] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Added `OpenAICompat.supportsMultipleSystemMessages` so chat-completions hosts can opt out of separate leading system blocks. Auto-detected as `true` for OpenAI, Azure, OpenRouter, Cerebras, Together, Fireworks, Groq, DeepSeek, Mistral, xAI, Z.ai, GitHub Copilot, and Zenmux; `false` for MiniMax, Alibaba Dashscope, and Qwen Portal whose chat templates reject follow-up system messages. Unknown OpenAI-compatible hosts (custom vLLM/local) default to `false`; users can opt back in via `compat.supportsMultipleSystemMessages: true`.

### Fixed

- Fixed strict-template OpenAI-compatible hosts (e.g. Qwen 3.5+ via vLLM, MiniMax) rejecting follow-up `system`/`developer` messages by coalescing ordered system prompts into a single block joined by `\n\n` when `compat.supportsMultipleSystemMessages` is false. Canonical hosts continue to receive separate blocks so KV-cache reuse stays effective when only the trailing prompt changes ([#958](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/958)).

## [14.7.2] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- Fixed VLLM model discovery to use `max_model_len` as the context window when the endpoint reports it.
- Fixed custom Ollama Cloud/local-proxy model aliases (for example `deepseek-v4-pro:cloud`) to inherit bundled cache-pricing metadata when the upstream model is known ([#937](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/937)).
- Fixed local Ollama model discovery to apply `/api/show` thinking and vision capabilities in addition to native context windows ([#928](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/928)).

## [14.7.0] - 2026-05-04
### Breaking Changes

- Changed `Context.systemPrompt` from a string to `string[]`, so callers must now pass an array of prompts instead of a single string
- Changed behavior will throw at runtime for non-array system prompts because request builders now normalize system prompts as an array

### Added

- Added support for multiple system prompts by changing `Context.systemPrompt` to an ordered string array and preserving provider-appropriate instruction precedence

### Changed

- Changed request builders for Anthropic, OpenAI, Bedrock, Azure, Cursor, Google, and Ollama to propagate every non-empty system prompt entry without demoting durable instructions into ordinary conversation turns

### Fixed

- Filtered out empty normalized system prompts so blank entries are no longer sent to providers
- Removed blank system prompt strings from provider payloads to avoid unnecessary empty instruction messages

## [14.6.6] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- Added always-on OpenRouter response caching (1h TTL) by sending `X-OpenRouter-Cache: true` and `X-OpenRouter-Cache-TTL: 3600` on every OpenRouter request — identical requests replay from OpenRouter's edge cache for free. https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/response-caching

## [14.6.4] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Codex websocket continuations to retry with full context when `previous_response_id` expires server-side instead of surfacing `previous_response_not_found`.

## [14.6.2] - 2026-05-03
### Added

- Added `EventStream.fail(err)` method to terminate the async iterator with an error, enabling consumers to catch stream-level failures via `for await` without hanging

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Responses tool schema conversion to rewrite non-strict `oneOf` unions to `anyOf` before sending tools to the Responses API ([#920](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/920))

## [14.6.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- Added `disableReasoning` to stream and OpenAI completion options to force reasoning off for models that support it, sending `reasoning: { enabled: false }` for OpenRouter-compatible requests
- Added `thinkingDisplay` option to Anthropic options to control whether adaptive and explicit reasoning is returned as `summarized` or `omitted`
- Added Anthropic model compatibility flags `supportsEagerToolInputStreaming` and `supportsLongCacheRetention` for API-capability-specific request behavior

### Changed

- Changed Anthropic request payloads to send `thinking: { type: "disabled" }` when `thinkingEnabled` is explicitly `false` on reasoning-enabled models
- Changed Anthropic cache retention handling so `cacheRetention: "long"` now uses `ttl: "1h"` only for canonical Anthropic endpoints with long-cache support
- Changed Anthropic tool schema generation to include `eager_input_streaming` only on models that advertise support
- Changed Anthropic OAuth login flow to include browser fallback guidance and richer error context when token exchange or refresh fails

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic non-thinking requests to include the caller-provided `temperature` value in request payloads
- Fixed Anthropic `claude-opus-4-7` non-thinking payloads to omit sampling fields (`temperature`, `top_p`, and `top_k`)
- Fixed OpenAI Codex base URL normalization so configured base URLs with or without `/codex` or `/codex/responses` now resolve to `/codex/responses`
- Fixed OpenAI Codex websocket handling to parse JSON from non-string message payloads including `ArrayBuffer`, typed arrays, and `Blob` values
- Fixed OpenAI Codex websocket handshakes to replace stale `openai-beta` values with the websocket beta and avoid sending request-body headers over websocket transport
- Fixed abort tracking so caller-initiated cancellations are treated as user aborts even after local watchdog timeouts, preventing unintended automatic retries
- Fixed Anthropic stream handling to parse raw SSE envelopes directly, ignore unrelated events, and repair malformed JSON in SSE payloads
- Fixed Anthropic streaming to emit an explicit error when the SSE stream ends without a `message_stop` event
- Fixed OpenAI Codex websocket continuations to send true `previous_response_id` deltas for `store: false` transcripts, expose request stats, and default text verbosity to `low` unless explicitly overridden.
- Fixed OpenAI Codex websocket append reuse after `response.completed` terminal events.

## [14.5.14] - 2026-05-01
### Added

- Added package-level `google-gemini-headers` exports (`getGeminiCliHeaders`, `getGeminiCliUserAgent`, `getAntigravityHeaders`, `extractRetryDelay`, and `ANTIGRAVITY_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION`) for header and retry handling reuse without importing full Google providers

### Changed

- Changed package exports and streaming/provider wiring to load heavy Google/Kimi/GitLab/synthetic provider modules lazily through `register-builtins`, reducing startup import overhead from optional provider SDKs

### Fixed

- Fixed DeepSeek V4 tool-call follow-up 400 errors from three root causes:
  - Mapped `reasoning_effort` "xhigh" to "max" for DeepSeek-family models on any provider (NVIDIA, OpenCode-Go, etc.), not just `deepseek`
  - Recovered `reasoning_content` from thinking blocks with valid signatures that were filtered by the non-empty-text check
- Added empty-string fallback when `reasoning_content` is genuinely absent (e.g. proxy-stripped) but the provider requires the field

## [14.5.13] - 2026-05-01

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `utils/oauth` re-exports from the package entrypoint, so OAuth helper imports from the root module must be updated

## [14.5.10] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Added provider response metadata callbacks for Anthropic and OpenAI streaming requests.

## [14.5.9] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Added `usage.reasoningTokens` to OpenAI and Google usage output when providers report reasoning/thinking tokens
- Added `usage.cttl.ephemeral5m` and `usage.cttl.ephemeral1h` to report Anthropic cache-write TTL token buckets
- Added `usage.server.webSearch` and `usage.server.webFetch` to report Anthropic server tool-call request counts

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI usage attribution to avoid double-counting `reasoning_tokens` in output totals
- Fixed Anthropic streaming usage handling so a previously populated cache TTL breakdown is preserved when later events omit `cache_creation`

## [14.5.4] - 2026-04-28

### Changed

- Changed OpenAI custom Lark grammar payloads to strip comments and blank lines before sending provider requests.

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Codex GPT model pricing by inheriting matching OpenAI catalog rates for zero-priced discovered Codex entries.

## [14.5.3] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- Added `fireworks` as a supported provider with API key login flow and credential storage
- Added Fireworks model catalog support with `fireworks`-scoped openai-completions models `glm-5`, `glm-5.1`, `kimi-k2.5`, `kimi-k2.6`, and `minimax-m2.7`
- Added built-in discovery wiring so providers with base URL `api.fireworks.ai` are recognized as OpenAI-compatible and can use streaming token control

### Changed

- Updated the built-in model catalog to use corrected `contextWindow` and `maxTokens` values for many existing models instead of placeholder limits
- Updated several model cost entries, including cache-read pricing, to corrected values

### Fixed

- Fixed Fireworks request formatting by translating between public model IDs and API wire IDs when sending OpenAI-completions requests
- Fixed OpenAI-compatible model parameter handling for Fireworks by allowing `max_tokens` to be sent during requests

## [14.5.1] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- Fixed NVIDIA NIM DeepSeek-V4 models leaking chat-template tool-call markers (e.g. `<｜DSML｜tool_calls｜>`) into visible response text by stripping the special tokens from streamed `delta.content` ([#798](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/798))

## [14.4.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- Added an `examples` option to `StringEnum` to include example values in the generated schema

### Changed

- Changed Anthropic tool schema generation to strip unsupported schema fields (including `patternProperties`), add `additionalProperties: false` for object types, and apply Anthropic strict-mode limits when marking tools as strict
- Changed Anthropic strict tool planning to cap strict `tools` at twenty entries and convert excess optional/union parameters to nullable schemas to stay within provider constraints

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic tool schema compilation failures by keeping the `write` tool out of the strict-tool allowlist when the full coding-agent tool set is active
- Fixed Anthropic 400 `tools.*.custom: For 'object' type, property 'minItems' is not supported` by stripping `minItems` from object-shaped JSON schema nodes (array nodes still keep supported `minItems` values)
- Fixed Anthropic tool schemas that used tuple-style arrays by stripping unsupported `maxItems` and only preserving provider-supported `minItems` values
- Fixed Anthropic and OpenRouter Anthropic tool calls that previously failed with `compiled grammar is too large` by retrying automatically without strict tool schemas and reusing non-strict mode for subsequent requests in the same provider session
- Fixed parsing of JSON tool arguments containing raw control characters inside string values (such as embedded newlines) by escaping them before JSON parsing
- Fixed `validateToolArguments` to accept stringified objects and arrays that include literal control characters inside string fields
- Fixed OpenAI Codex Spark OAuth selection to fall back to non-Pro accounts when no ChatGPT Pro account is connected, so users without a Pro account can still attempt Spark requests in case the server permits access.

## [14.3.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- Added support for Claude Opus 4.7 (`claude-opus-4-7`) model ([#726](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/726))
  - Suppresses sampling parameters (temperature/top_p/top_k) that Opus 4.7 rejects
  - Enables `display: "summarized"` for adaptive thinking to restore visible thinking content

### Fixed

- Fixed Cursor provider losing conversation history on follow-up turns (model responding "this appears to be the start of our session") by populating `ConversationStateStructure.rootPromptMessagesJson` with JSON blob IDs for the system prompt plus prior user/assistant/tool-result messages. Cursor's server builds the model prompt from `rootPromptMessagesJson`, not from the protobuf `turns[]` tree, so sending only the system prompt there caused prior turns to be dropped
- Fixed Cursor provider multi-turn conversations failing with `Connect error internal: Blob not found` on the second message by storing `ConversationStateStructure.turns`, `AgentConversationTurnStructure.user_message`, and `AgentConversationTurnStructure.steps` as content-addressed blob IDs in the KV store (matching the existing handling for `rootPromptMessagesJson`) rather than sending the raw serialized bytes inline ([#678](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/678))

## [14.2.1] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Codex Spark OAuth selection to require a verified ChatGPT Pro account instead of falling back to Plus or unknown-plan accounts.

## [14.2.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- Added `gpt-5.5` to the built-in model catalog for both OpenAI Responses (`openai`) and local `litellm` (`openai-completions`) providers
- Added `gpt-image-2` to the `litellm` built-in model catalog
- Added `isCopilotTransientModelError()` and `callWithCopilotModelRetry()` helpers in `utils/retry` that detect GitHub Copilot's intermittent `HTTP 400 model_not_supported` responses for preview models (`gpt-5.3-codex`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, ...) and retry the request up to three times with backoff. OpenAI Responses, OpenAI Completions, and Anthropic provider paths now participate in this retry when the model is served through Copilot.
- Added OpenAI Responses custom-tool grammar support for Codex-style `apply_patch` calls, including freeform streaming, history replay, and forced tool-choice mapping to the custom wire name.

### Changed

- Updated built-in model metadata with revised `contextWindow`, `maxTokens`, and pricing values for existing entries
- Changed generated model policies to assign `applyPatchToolType: "freeform"` for first-party GPT-5 OpenAI Responses and Codex models, so regenerated `models.json` preserves the `apply_patch` custom-tool metadata.
- Renamed `rewriteCopilotAuthError` to `rewriteCopilotError` and extended it to rewrite `HTTP 400 model_not_supported` after retries are exhausted with guidance about Copilot's OAuth-client-specific rollout gap (see opencode#13313).

### Fixed

- Fixed Amazon Bedrock proxy handling to honor lowercase `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `all_proxy` environment variables when using HTTP/1 fallback
- Fixed Amazon Bedrock streaming behind corporate HTTP proxies by using a proxy-aware HTTP/1 transport when `HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, or `ALL_PROXY` is configured, including AWS SSO credential calls.
- Fixed Amazon Bedrock requests to retry once with HTTP/1 when the AWS SDK's default HTTP/2 transport fails before streaming begins.
- Fixed OpenAI Responses streaming to display thinking tokens from local providers (llama.cpp, etc.) that send raw `reasoning_text.delta` events and empty `summary` arrays in `output_item.done`. Previously, thinking content was silently dropped during streaming while non-streaming mode worked correctly.
- Synced the bundled OpenCode Go catalog with the current docs so `kimi-k2.6`, `mimo-v2.5`, and `mimo-v2.5-pro` appear in offline/default model lists.

## [14.1.3] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- Preserved user-provided `session_id` and `x-client-request-id` headers in OpenAI Responses requests instead of overriding them with automatic session-derived values
- Stopped sending `session_id` and `x-client-request-id` headers for OpenAI Responses requests when `cacheRetention` is set to `none`
- Fixed direct OpenAI Responses requests to send `session_id` and `x-client-request-id` from the same session-derived value as `prompt_cache_key`, improving prompt cache affinity for append-only sessions

## [14.1.1] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- Added `toolStrictMode` compatibility option (`"all_strict"` or `"none"`) to OpenAI-compatible model config to force tool schemas to be sent uniformly strict, uniformly non-strict, or keep mixed per-tool behavior

### Changed

- Changed Cerebras OpenAI-compatible providers to default `toolStrictMode` to `"all_strict"` unless explicitly overridden

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Completions handling for providers that reject mixed `strict` flags by automatically retrying with non-strict tool schemas when an initial all-strict tool request fails with strict-format 400/422 errors
- Fixed OpenAI-completions error reporting by including captured JSON error body details such as type, param, and code when a request fails without a body in the thrown SDK error
- Fixed shell execution failure responses to preserve all result fields when sanitizing, preventing truncated metadata in stream results
- Fixed context overflow detection to recognize `model_context_window_exceeded` from z.ai / GLM providers, preventing infinite retry loops when context window is exceeded ([#638](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/638))
- Fixed strict tool schema enforcement to preserve `additionalProperties: false` and required keys for reused nested object schemas, preventing invalid `todo_write` function schemas in Codex/OpenAI requests
- Fixed GitHub Copilot reasoning regressions by preserving GPT-5.x / Claude 4.x reasoning controls instead of stripping them from requests ([#773](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/773))

## [14.1.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- Added `accountId` to usage report metadata

### Changed

- Changed usage parsing to emit a usage report with available fields when parsing fails, rather than returning null

### Fixed

- Fixed `planType` resolution to fall back to the raw payload `plan_type` when parsed value is absent
- Fixed usage metadata `raw` fallback to preserve the original payload when parsed raw output is missing

## [14.0.5] - 2026-04-11

### Changed

- Replaced GitHub Copilot authentication from VSCode extension impersonation to the opencode OAuth flow, eliminating TOS concerns. Existing users will need to re-authenticate once with `/login github-copilot`.
- Simplified Copilot token handling: GitHub OAuth token is used directly for all API requests (no JWT exchange or refresh cycle).
- Changed GitHub Copilot API base URL from `api.individual.githubcopilot.com` to `api.githubcopilot.com`.
- Updated default OpenAI stream idle timeout to 120,000 milliseconds to keep stream generation alive longer

### Fixed

- Fixed duplicate synthetic tool results being generated when a real tool result appears later in message history
- Fixed GitHub Copilot `/models` discovery to unwrap structured OAuth credentials before sending the bearer token, preserving dynamic catalog refresh for OAuth-backed callers.

### Removed

- Removed Copilot JWT proxy-ep base URL resolution (no longer needed with opencode auth).

## [14.0.3] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- Fixed Ollama discovery cache normalization so cached models upgrade to the OpenAI Responses transport after the provider change

## [14.0.0] - 2026-04-08

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `coerceNullStrings` function and its automatic null-string coercion behavior from JSON parsing

### Added

- Added support for OpenRouter provider with strict mode detection
- Added automatic cleaning of literal escape sequences (`\n`, `\t`, `\r`) in JSON parsing to handle LLM encoding confusion
- Added support for healing JSON with trailing junk after balanced containers (e.g., `]\n</invoke>`)
- Added `CODEX_STARTUP_EVENT_CHANNEL` constant and `CodexStartupEvent` type for monitoring Codex provider initialization status
- Added automatic healing of malformed JSON with single-character bracket errors at the end of strings, improving LLM tool argument parsing robustness

## [13.19.0] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- Fixed GitHub Copilot model context window detection by correcting fallback priority for maxContextWindowTokens and maxPromptTokens
- Fixed Gemini 2.5 Pro context window detection in GitHub Copilot model limits test
- Fixed Claude Opus 4.6 context window detection in GitHub Copilot model limits test
- Fixed Anthropic streaming to suppress transient SDK console errors for malformed SSE keep-alive frames so the TUI only shows surfaced provider errors

- Added environment-based credential fallback for the OpenAI Codex provider.

## [13.17.6] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic first-event timeouts to exclude stream connection setup from the watchdog, preserve timeout-specific retry classification after local aborts, and reset retry state cleanly between attempts

## [13.17.5] - 2026-04-01

### Changed

- Increased default first-event timeout from 15s to 45s to better accommodate longer request setup times
- Modified first-event watchdog to inherit idle timeout when it exceeds the default, ensuring consistent timeout behavior across different configurations

### Fixed

- Fixed first-event watchdog initialization timing so it no longer starts before the actual stream request is created, preventing premature timeouts during request setup
- Fixed first-event watchdog timing so OpenAI-family providers no longer count slow request setup against the first streamed event timeout, and raised the default first-event timeout to avoid false aborts after long tool turns

## [13.17.2] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed

- System instruction injection for Antigravity scoped to Claude and `gemini-3-pro-high` models only

### Removed

## [13.3.14] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- Exported schema utilities from new `./utils/schema` module, consolidating JSON Schema handling across providers
- Added `CredentialRankingStrategy` interface for providers to implement usage-based credential selection
- Added `claudeRankingStrategy` for Anthropic OAuth credentials to enable smart multi-account selection based on usage windows
- Added `codexRankingStrategy` for OpenAI Codex OAuth credentials with priority boost for fresh 5-hour window starts
- Added `adaptSchemaForStrict()` helper for unified OpenAI strict schema enforcement across providers
- Added schema equality and merging utilities: `areJsonValuesEqual()`, `mergeCompatibleEnumSchemas()`, `mergePropertySchemas()`
- Added Cloud Code Assist schema normalization: `copySchemaWithout()`, `stripResidualCombiners()`, `prepareSchemaForCCA()`
- Added `sanitizeSchemaForGoogle()` and `sanitizeSchemaForCCA()` for provider-specific schema sanitization
- Added `StringEnum()` helper for creating string enum schemas compatible with Google and other providers
- Added `enforceStrictSchema()` and `sanitizeSchemaForStrictMode()` for OpenAI strict mode schema validation
- Added package exports for `./utils/schema` and `./utils/schema/*` subpaths
- Added `validateSchemaCompatibility()` to statically audit a JSON Schema against provider-specific rules (`openai-strict`, `google`, `cloud-code-assist-claude`) and return structured violations
- Added `validateStrictSchemaEnforcement()` to verify the strict-fail-open contract: enforced schemas pass strict validation, failed schemas return the original object identity
- Added `COMBINATOR_KEYS` (`anyOf`, `allOf`, `oneOf`) and `CCA_UNSUPPORTED_SCHEMA_FIELDS` as exported constants in `fields.ts` to eliminate duplication across modules
- Added `tryEnforceStrictSchema` result cache (`WeakMap`) to avoid redundant sanitize + enforce work for the same schema object
- Added comprehensive schema normalization test suite (`schema-normalization.test.ts`) covering strict mode, Google, and Cloud Code Assist normalization paths
- Added schema compatibility validation test suite (`schema-compatibility.test.ts`) covering all three provider targets

### Changed

- Moved schema utilities from `./utils/typebox-helpers` to new `./utils/schema` module with expanded functionality
- Refactored OpenAI provider tool conversion to use unified `adaptSchemaForStrict()` helper across codex, completions, and responses
- Updated `AuthStorage` to support generic credential ranking via `CredentialRankingStrategy` instead of Codex-only logic
- Moved Google schema sanitization functions from `google-shared.ts` to `./utils/schema` module
- Changed export path: `./utils/typebox-helpers` → `./utils/schema` in main index
- `sanitizeSchemaForGoogle()` / `sanitizeSchemaForCCA()` now accept a parameterized `unsupportedFields` set internally, enabling code reuse between the two sanitizers
- `copySchemaWithout()` rewritten using object-rest destructuring for clarity

### Fixed

- Fixed cycle detection: `WeakSet` guards added to all recursive schema traversals (`sanitizeSchemaForStrictMode`, `enforceStrictSchema`, `normalizeSchemaForCCA`, `normalizeNullablePropertiesForCloudCodeAssist`, `stripResidualCombiners`, `sanitizeSchemaImpl`, `hasResidualCloudCodeAssistIncompatibilities`) — circular schemas no longer cause infinite loops or stack overflows
- Fixed `hasResidualCloudCodeAssistIncompatibilities`: cycle detection now returns `false` (not `true`) for already-visited nodes, eliminating false positives that forced the CCA fallback schema on valid recursive inputs
- Fixed `stripResidualCombiners` to iterate to a fixpoint rather than making a single pass, ensuring chained combiner reductions (where one reduction enables another) are fully resolved
- Fixed `mergeObjectCombinerVariants` required-field computation: the flattened object now takes the intersection of all variants' `required` arrays (unioned with own-level required properties that exist in the merged schema), preventing required fields from being silently dropped or over-included
- Fixed `mergeCompatibleEnumSchemas` to use deep structural equality (`areJsonValuesEqual`) instead of `Object.is` when deduplicating object-valued enum members
- Fixed `sanitizeSchemaForGoogle` const-to-enum deduplication to use deep equality instead of reference equality
- Fixed `sanitizeSchemaForGoogle` type inference for `anyOf`/`oneOf`-flattened const enums: type is now derived from all variants (must agree), falling back to inference from enum values; mixed null/non-null infers the non-null type and sets `nullable`
- Fixed `sanitizeSchemaForGoogle` recursion to spread options when descending (previously only `insideProperties`, `normalizeTypeArrayToNullable`, `stripNullableKeyword` were forwarded; new fields `unsupportedFields` and `seen` were silently dropped)
- Fixed `sanitizeSchemaForGoogle` array-valued `type` filtering to exclude non-string entries before processing
- Removed incorrect `additionalProperties: false` stripping from `sanitizeSchemaForGoogle` (the field is valid in Google schemas when `false`)
- Fixed `sanitizeSchemaForStrictMode` to strip the `nullable` keyword and expand it into `anyOf: [schema, {type: "null"}]` in the output, matching what OpenAI strict mode actually expects
- Fixed `sanitizeSchemaForStrictMode` to infer `type: "array"` when `items` is present but `type` is absent
- Fixed `sanitizeSchemaForStrictMode` to infer a scalar `type` from uniform `enum` values when `type` is not explicitly set
- Fixed `sanitizeSchemaForStrictMode` const-to-enum merge to use deep equality, preventing duplicate enum entries when `const` and `enum` both exist with the same value
- Fixed `enforceStrictSchema` to drop `additionalProperties` unconditionally (previously only object-valued `additionalProperties` was recursed into; non-object values were passed through, violating strict schema requirements)
- Fixed `enforceStrictSchema` to recurse into `$defs` and `definitions` blocks so referenced sub-schemas are also made strict-compliant
- Fixed `enforceStrictSchema` to handle tuple-style `items` arrays (previously only single-schema `items` objects were recursed)
- Fixed `enforceStrictSchema` double-wrapping: optional properties already expressed as `anyOf: [..., {type: "null"}]` are not wrapped again
- Fixed `enforceStrictSchema` `Array.isArray` type-narrowing for `type` field to filter non-string entries before checking for `"object"`

### Changed

- Changed strict mode handling in OpenAI providers to use `tryEnforceStrictSchema` for safer schema enforcement with automatic fallback to non-strict mode

- `thinkingBudgets` option in `SimpleStreamOptions` for customizing token budgets per thinking level on token-based providers ([#529](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/529) by [@melihmucuk](https://github.com/melihmucuk))

### Breaking Changes

- Removed OpenAI Codex model aliases (`gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, `codex-mini-latest`, `gpt-5-codex`, `gpt-5.1-codex`, `gpt-5.1-chat-latest`). Use canonical model IDs: `gpt-5.1`, `gpt-5.1-codex-max`, `gpt-5.1-codex-mini`, `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5.2-codex`. ([#536](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/536) by [@ghoulr](https://github.com/ghoulr))

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Codex context window from 400,000 to 272,000 tokens to match Codex CLI defaults and prevent 400 errors. ([#536](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/536) by [@ghoulr](https://github.com/ghoulr))
- Fixed Codex SSE error events to surface message, code, and status. ([#551](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/551) by [@tmustier](https://github.com/tmustier))
- Fixed context overflow detection for `context_length_exceeded` error codes.

## [0.37.6] - 2026-01-06

### Added

- Exported OpenAI Codex utilities: `CacheMetadata`, `getCodexInstructions`, `getModelFamily`, `ModelFamily`, `buildCodexPiBridge`, `buildCodexSystemPrompt`, `CodexSystemPrompt` ([#510](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/510) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))

## [0.37.3] - 2026-01-06

### Added

- `sessionId` option in `StreamOptions` for providers that support session-based caching. OpenAI Codex provider uses this to set `prompt_cache_key` and routing headers.

## [0.37.2] - 2026-01-05

### Fixed

- Codex provider now always includes `reasoning.encrypted_content` even when custom `include` options are passed ([#484](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/484) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

## [0.37.0] - 2026-01-05

### Breaking Changes

- OpenAI Codex models no longer have per-thinking-level variants (e.g., `gpt-5.2-codex-high`). Use the base model ID and set thinking level separately. The Codex provider clamps reasoning effort to what each model supports internally. (initial implementation by [@ben-vargas](https://github.com/ben-vargas) in [#472](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/472))

### Added

- Headless OAuth support for all callback-server providers (Google Gemini CLI, Antigravity, OpenAI Codex): paste redirect URL when browser callback is unreachable ([#428](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/428) by [@ben-vargas](https://github.com/ben-vargas), [#468](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/468) by [@crcatala](https://github.com/crcatala))
- Cancellable GitHub Copilot device code polling via AbortSignal

### Fixed

- Codex requests now omit the `reasoning` field entirely when thinking is off, letting the backend use its default instead of forcing a value. ([#472](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/472))

## [0.36.0] - 2026-01-05

### Added

- OpenAI Codex OAuth provider with Responses API streaming support: `openai-codex-responses` streaming provider with SSE parsing, tool-call handling, usage/cost tracking, and PKCE OAuth flow ([#451](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/451) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

### Fixed

- Vertex AI dummy value for `getEnvApiKey()`: Returns `"<authenticated>"` when Application Default Credentials are configured (`~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json` exists) and both `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` (or `GCLOUD_PROJECT`) and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` are set. This allows `streamSimple()` to work with Vertex AI without explicit `apiKey` option. The ADC credentials file existence check is cached per-process to avoid repeated filesystem access.

## [0.32.3] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed

- Google Vertex AI models no longer appear in available models list without explicit authentication. Previously, `getEnvApiKey()` returned a dummy value for `google-vertex`, causing models to show up even when Google Cloud ADC was not configured.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-01-03

### Added

- Vertex AI provider with ADC (Application Default Credentials) support. Authenticate with `gcloud auth application-default login`, set `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`, and access Gemini models via Vertex AI. ([#300](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/300) by [@default-anton](https://github.com/default-anton))

### Fixed

- **Gemini CLI rate limit handling**: Added automatic retry with server-provided delay for 429 errors. Parses delay from error messages like "Your quota will reset after 39s" and waits accordingly. Falls back to exponential backoff for other transient errors. ([#370](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/370))

## [0.31.0] - 2026-01-02

### Breaking Changes

- **Agent API moved**: All agent functionality (`agentLoop`, `agentLoopContinue`, `AgentContext`, `AgentEvent`, `AgentTool`, `AgentToolResult`, etc.) has moved to `@mariozechner/pi-agent-core`. Import from that package instead of `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai`.

### Added

- **`GoogleThinkingLevel` type**: Exported type that mirrors Google's `ThinkingLevel` enum values (`"THINKING_LEVEL_UNSPECIFIED" | "MINIMAL" | "LOW" | "MEDIUM" | "HIGH"`). Allows configuring Gemini thinking levels without importing from `@google/genai`.
- **`ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN` env var**: Now checked before `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `getEnvApiKey()`, allowing OAuth tokens to take precedence.
- **`event-stream.js` export**: `AssistantMessageEventStream` utility now exported from package index.

### Changed

- **OAuth uses Web Crypto API**: PKCE generation and OAuth flows now use Web Crypto API (`crypto.subtle`) instead of Node.js `crypto` module. This improves browser compatibility while still working in Node.js 20+.
- **Deterministic model generation**: `generate-models.ts` now sorts providers and models alphabetically for consistent output across runs. ([#332](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/332) by [@mrexodia](https://github.com/mrexodia))

### Fixed

- **OpenAI completions empty content blocks**: Empty text or thinking blocks in assistant messages are now filtered out before sending to the OpenAI completions API, preventing validation errors. ([#344](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/344) by [@default-anton](https://github.com/default-anton))
- **Thinking token duplication**: Fixed thinking content duplication with chutes.ai provider. The provider was returning thinking content in both `reasoning_content` and `reasoning` fields, causing each chunk to be processed twice. Now only the first non-empty reasoning field is used.
- **zAi provider API mapping**: Fixed zAi models to use `openai-completions` API with correct base URL (`https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4`) instead of incorrect Anthropic API mapping. ([#344](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/344), [#358](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/358) by [@default-anton](https://github.com/default-anton))

## [0.28.0] - 2025-12-25

### Breaking Changes

- **OAuth storage removed** ([#296](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/296)): All storage functions (`loadOAuthCredentials`, `saveOAuthCredentials`, `setOAuthStorage`, etc.) removed. Callers are responsible for storing credentials.
- **OAuth login functions**: `loginAnthropic`, `loginGitHubCopilot`, `loginGeminiCli`, `loginAntigravity` now return `OAuthCredentials` instead of saving to disk.
- **refreshOAuthToken**: Now takes `(provider, credentials)` and returns new `OAuthCredentials` instead of saving.
- **getOAuthApiKey**: Now takes `(provider, credentials)` and returns `{ newCredentials, apiKey }` or null.
- **OAuthCredentials type**: No longer includes `type: "oauth"` discriminator. Callers add discriminator when storing.
- **setApiKey, resolveApiKey**: Removed. Callers must manage their own API key storage/resolution.
- **getApiKey**: Renamed to `getEnvApiKey`. Only checks environment variables for known providers.

## [0.27.7] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed

- **Thinking tag leakage**: Fixed Claude mimicking literal `</thinking>` tags in responses. Unsigned thinking blocks (from aborted streams) are now converted to plain text without `<thinking>` tags. The TUI still displays them as thinking blocks. ([#302](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/302) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

## [0.25.1] - 2025-12-21

### Added

- **xhigh thinking level support**: Added `supportsXhigh()` function to check if a model supports xhigh reasoning level. Also clamps xhigh to high for OpenAI models that don't support it. ([#236](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/236) by [@theBucky](https://github.com/theBucky))

### Fixed

- **Gemini multimodal tool results**: Fixed images in tool results causing flaky/broken responses with Gemini models. For Gemini 3, images are now nested inside `functionResponse.parts` per the [docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling#multimodal). For older models (which don't support multimodal function responses), images are sent in a separate user message.

- **Queued message steering**: When `getQueuedMessages` is provided, the agent loop now checks for queued user messages after each tool call and skips remaining tool calls in the current assistant message when a queued message arrives (emitting error tool results).

- **Double API version path in Google provider URL**: Fixed Gemini API calls returning 404 after baseUrl support was added. The SDK was appending its default apiVersion to baseUrl which already included the version path. ([#251](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/251) by [@shellfyred](https://github.com/shellfyred))

- **Anthropic SDK retries disabled**: Re-enabled SDK-level retries (default 2) for transient HTTP failures. ([#252](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/252))

## [0.23.5] - 2025-12-19

### Added

- **Gemini 3 Flash thinking support**: Extended thinking level support for Gemini 3 Flash models (MINIMAL, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) to match Pro models' capabilities. ([#212](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/212) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

- **GitHub Copilot thinking models**: Added thinking support for additional Copilot models (o3-mini, o1-mini, o1-preview). ([#234](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/234) by [@aadishv](https://github.com/aadishv))

### Fixed

- **Gemini tool result format**: Fixed tool result format for Gemini 3 Flash Preview which strictly requires `{ output: value }` for success and `{ error: value }` for errors. Previous format using `{ result, isError }` was rejected by newer Gemini models. Also improved type safety by removing `as any` casts. ([#213](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/213), [#220](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/220))

- **Google baseUrl configuration**: Google provider now respects `baseUrl` configuration for custom endpoints or API proxies. ([#216](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/216), [#221](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/221) by [@theBucky](https://github.com/theBucky))

- **GitHub Copilot vision requests**: Added `Copilot-Vision-Request` header when sending images to GitHub Copilot models. ([#222](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/222))

- **GitHub Copilot X-Initiator header**: Fixed X-Initiator logic to check last message role instead of any message in history. This ensures proper billing when users send follow-up messages. ([#209](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/209))

## [0.22.3] - 2025-12-16

### Added

- **Image limits test suite**: Added comprehensive tests for provider-specific image limitations (max images, max size, max dimensions). Discovered actual limits: Anthropic (100 images, 5MB, 8000px), OpenAI (500 images, ≥25MB), Gemini (~2500 images, ≥40MB), Mistral (8 images, ~15MB), OpenRouter (~40 images context-limited, ~15MB). ([#120](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/120))

- **Tool result streaming**: Added `tool_execution_update` event and optional `onUpdate` callback to `AgentTool.execute()` for streaming tool output during execution. Tools can now emit partial results (e.g., bash stdout) that are forwarded to subscribers. ([#44](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/44))

- **X-Initiator header for GitHub Copilot**: Added X-Initiator header handling for GitHub Copilot provider to ensure correct call accounting (agent calls are not deducted from quota). Sets initiator based on last message role. ([#200](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/200) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

### Changed

- **Normalized tool_execution_end result**: `tool_execution_end` event now always contains `AgentToolResult` (no longer `AgentToolResult | string`). Errors are wrapped in the standard result format.

### Fixed

- **Reasoning disabled by default**: When `reasoning` option is not specified, thinking is now explicitly disabled for all providers. Previously, some providers like Gemini with "dynamic thinking" would use their default (thinking ON), causing unexpected token usage. This was the original intended behavior. ([#180](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/180) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.22.2] - 2025-12-15

### Added

- **Interleaved thinking for Anthropic**: Added `interleavedThinking` option to `AnthropicOptions`. When enabled, Claude 4 models can think between tool calls and reason after receiving tool results. Enabled by default (no extra token cost, just unlocks the capability). Set `interleavedThinking: false` to disable.

## [0.22.1] - 2025-12-15

_Dedicated to Peter's shoulder ([@steipete](https://twitter.com/steipete))_

### Added

- **Interleaved thinking for Anthropic**: Enabled interleaved thinking in the Anthropic provider, allowing Claude models to output thinking blocks interspersed with text responses.

## [0.22.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added

- **GitHub Copilot provider**: Added `github-copilot` as a known provider with models sourced from models.dev. Includes Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok, and other models available through GitHub Copilot. ([#191](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/191) by [@cau1k](https://github.com/cau1k))

### Fixed

- **GitHub Copilot gpt-5 models**: Fixed API selection for gpt-5 models to use `openai-responses` instead of `openai-completions` (gpt-5 models are not accessible via completions endpoint)

- **GitHub Copilot cross-model context handoff**: Fixed context handoff failing when switching between GitHub Copilot models using different APIs (e.g., gpt-5 to claude-sonnet-4). Tool call IDs from OpenAI Responses API were incompatible with other models. ([#198](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/198))

- **Gemini 3 Pro thinking levels**: Thinking level configuration now works correctly for Gemini 3 Pro models. Previously all levels mapped to -1 (minimal thinking). Now LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH properly control test-time computation. ([#176](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/176) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.18.2] - 2025-12-11

### Changed

- **Anthropic SDK retries disabled**: Set `maxRetries: 0` on Anthropic client to allow application-level retry handling. The SDK's built-in retries were interfering with coding-agent's retry logic. ([#157](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/157))

## [0.18.1] - 2025-12-10

### Added

- **Mistral provider**: Added support for Mistral AI models via the OpenAI-compatible API. Includes automatic handling of Mistral-specific requirements (tool call ID format). Set `MISTRAL_API_KEY` environment variable to use.

### Fixed

- Fixed Mistral 400 errors after aborted assistant messages by skipping empty assistant messages (no content, no tool calls) ([#165](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/165))

- Removed synthetic assistant bridge message after tool results for Mistral (no longer required as of Dec 2025) ([#165](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/165))

- Fixed bug where `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable was deleted globally after first OAuth token usage, causing subsequent prompts to fail ([#164](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/164))

## [0.17.0] - 2025-12-09

### Added

- **`agentLoopContinue` function**: Continue an agent loop from existing context without adding a new user message. Validates that the last message is `user` or `toolResult`. Useful for retry after context overflow or resuming from manually-added tool results.

### Breaking Changes

- Removed provider-level tool argument validation. Validation now happens in `agentLoop` via `executeToolCalls`, allowing models to retry on validation errors. For manual tool execution, use `validateToolCall(tools, toolCall)` or `validateToolArguments(tool, toolCall)`.

### Added

- Added `validateToolCall(tools, toolCall)` helper that finds the tool by name and validates arguments.

- **OpenAI compatibility overrides**: Added `compat` field to `Model` for `openai-completions` API, allowing explicit configuration of provider quirks (`supportsStore`, `supportsDeveloperRole`, `supportsReasoningEffort`, `maxTokensField`). Falls back to URL-based detection if not set. Useful for LiteLLM, custom proxies, and other non-standard endpoints. ([#133](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/133), thanks @fink-andreas for the initial idea and PR)

- **xhigh reasoning level**: Added `xhigh` to `ReasoningEffort` type for OpenAI codex-max models. For non-OpenAI providers (Anthropic, Google), `xhigh` is automatically mapped to `high`. ([#143](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/143))

### Changed

- **Updated SDK versions**: OpenAI SDK 5.21.0 → 6.10.0, Anthropic SDK 0.61.0 → 0.71.2, Google GenAI SDK 1.30.0 → 1.31.0

## [0.13.0] - 2025-12-06

### Breaking Changes

- **Added `totalTokens` field to `Usage` type**: All code that constructs `Usage` objects must now include the `totalTokens` field. This field represents the total tokens processed by the LLM (input + output + cache). For OpenAI and Google, this uses native API values (`total_tokens`, `totalTokenCount`). For Anthropic, it's computed as `input + output + cacheRead + cacheWrite`.

## [0.12.10] - 2025-12-04

### Added

- Added `gpt-5.1-codex-max` model support

### Fixed

- **OpenAI Token Counting**: Fixed `usage.input` to exclude cached tokens for OpenAI providers. Previously, `input` included cached tokens, causing double-counting when calculating total context size via `input + cacheRead`. Now `input` represents non-cached input tokens across all providers, making `input + output + cacheRead + cacheWrite` the correct formula for total context size.

- **Fixed Claude Opus 4.5 cache pricing** (was 3x too expensive)
  - Corrected cache_read: $1.50 → $0.50 per MTok
  - Corrected cache_write: $18.75 → $6.25 per MTok
  - Added manual override in `scripts/generate-models.ts` until upstream fix is merged
  - Submitted PR to models.dev: https://github.com/sst/models.dev/pull/439

## [0.9.4] - 2025-11-26

Initial release with multi-provider LLM support.
