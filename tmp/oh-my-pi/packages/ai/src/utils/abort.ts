/**
 * Tracks whether a merged request signal was aborted by the caller or by provider-local logic.
 *
 * Caller aborts always take priority. When both the caller and a local watchdog fire near
 * each other, the merged `requestSignal.reason` reflects whichever AbortController called
 * `.abort()` first — but ordering is racy and not meaningful for upstream consumers. What
 * matters is intent: if the caller's signal aborted, the request was cancelled by the
 * caller, and any local watchdog reason is incidental and **MUST NOT** be surfaced as a
 * retryable transient error (which would cause auto-retry to re-enter streaming and leave
 * the UI showing a spinner the user already tried to cancel).
