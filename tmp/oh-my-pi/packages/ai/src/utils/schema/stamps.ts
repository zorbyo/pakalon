 * Symbol-keyed lazy memoization stamped directly onto the host object.
 *
 * Faster than a module-level `WeakMap` in V8/JSC because the symbol slot is
 * resolved through the object's hidden class instead of a side-table hash
 * lookup. The slot is defined as a non-enumerable property so the stamp
 * does not leak through `{...spread}`, `Object.keys`, `JSON.stringify`, or
 * `toEqual`-style deep equality.
 *
 * Caveats: the stamp lives as long as the host object, even after callers
 * release their references to the cached value — only use this for caches
 * whose lifetime should match the host. Frozen hosts will throw on write in
 * strict mode; callers that may receive frozen input must handle that.
