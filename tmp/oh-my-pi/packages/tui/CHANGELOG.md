# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [15.7.3] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- Added `overflowSearch` to `SelectListLayoutOptions` to let consumers enable or disable type-to-filter search and search-status rendering per SelectList instance
- Added fuzzy type-to-filter search to overflowing `SelectList` pickers, with search status and result counts.
- Added `TUI.setEagerNativeScrollbackRebuild(enabled)` — while enabled, live render frames rebuild native scrollback on offscreen/structural changes even when the viewport position is unobservable (POSIX), instead of deferring to a non-destructive repaint. Trades the anti-yank guarantee for clean, duplicate-free history; intended for windows where output above the fold is actively re-laying out (e.g. a tool whose result is still streaming). A terminal that reports a known-scrolled viewport still defers.

### Changed

- Disabled interactive search filtering for editor autocomplete and slash-command `SelectList`s by passing `overflowSearch: false` in their layout options

### Fixed

- Preserved hidden tmux overlays in the live viewport by removing overlay content from view when an overlay was hidden while keeping pane history intact
- Preserved native scrollback when forced TUI renders coalesce with content growth, and deferred pure tail appends while readers are scrolled into history.
- Preserved existing terminal scrollback during forced and structural TUI renders so preexisting shell lines remained visible after component mutations
- Rebuilt native scrollback for safe bottom-anchored offscreen edits and high-water preview collapses instead of repainting only the viewport, preventing stale or duplicated rows above the live viewport.
- Stripped internal cursor marker sentinels from all rendered lines so offscreen focus markers no longer leak into terminal output
- Truncated all painted lines to terminal width during viewport repaints and append-tail updates so long content no longer overflows or wraps unexpectedly
- Fixed `tui.select.cancel` handling in `SelectList` so pressing Escape or Ctrl+C closes the list even when no matches are currently shown
- Fixed native scrollback corruption when an offscreen row edit and repeated-tail append land in one render frame; ambiguous appended tails now rebuild history instead of splicing stale rows into the buffer.
- Fixed scrolled-up readers being yanked back to the tail whenever streaming content arrived on POSIX terminals (macOS/Linux). Native viewport position is unobservable there (`isNativeViewportAtBottom()` returns `undefined`), and the planner optimistically treated "unknown" as "at bottom", so every offscreen streaming edit ran a destructive `historyRebuild` that cleared scrollback and snapped the view to the bottom. Live render frames now treat an unknown viewport as unsafe for a destructive rebuild — they defer to a non-destructive viewport repaint and reconcile native scrollback at the next explicit checkpoint (prompt submit). Resize and checkpoint replays keep the prior behavior.
- Fixed native scrollback not rewrapping when the terminal widens on POSIX. A width increase reflows the transcript to fewer lines, which the shrink-across-boundary branch intercepted and (after the unknown-viewport deferral) repainted only the viewport — leaving committed history wrapped at the old width and duplicated above the live viewport. Width changes now rebuild native scrollback at the new geometry even when the viewport position is unknown (a yank is acceptable on an explicit resize); a terminal that can report a scrolled viewport still defers.

## [15.7.0] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- Fixed slash-command autocomplete repainting when a Windows Terminal session cannot report native scrollback position; live input renders can now bypass the unknown-viewport deferral without weakening background scrollback protection. ([#1550](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1550))

## [15.6.0] - 2026-05-30
### Added

- Added autocomplete triggering for internal URL scheme tokens such as `local://` and `skill://` while typing in the editor

### Fixed

- Fixed streaming output staying invisible in Windows Terminal + WSL2 until the window was minimized + restored. The 15.5.14 WSL branch of `requiresNativeViewportProofForReplay` treated an unknown native viewport state as "scrolled into history" — but `ProcessTerminal.isNativeViewportAtBottom` can only return a real answer through `kernel32.dll` FFI, which a Linux user-space process inside WSL cannot load, so the probe was permanently `undefined`. Every row-inserting structural mutation (each new streaming token row above the bottom-anchored prompt) was therefore classified as `deferredMutation` and emitted zero bytes. Any geometry change (resize/minimize/restore) bypassed the gate via a different render intent, which is why the output became visible only on window resize. The WSL clause is removed; on platforms where the probe cannot answer, unknown is treated as at-bottom (the pre-15.5.14 behaviour) so the live render path runs again. Native Win32 keeps the conservative "assume scrolled when unknown" heuristic since `kernel32` FFI does succeed there and unknown means the probe transiently failed. ([#1534](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1534))

## [15.5.14] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- `Markdown` now renders a small color-chip swatch, painted with the referenced color, in front of CSS hex colors mentioned in prose, thinking traces, lists, tables, and blockquotes (e.g. `#C5FFD6` or `` `#C5FFD6` ``). The chip glyph comes from the theme's symbol set so it degrades across tiers (Nerd Font / Unicode `■` → ASCII `[]`) and is overridable via the `md.colorSwatch` symbol. Truecolor terminals get an exact 24-bit chip; others fall back to the nearest 256-color cell. Bare prose requires a hex letter for 3/4-digit forms so short issue/PR references (`#123`, `#1011`) don't sprout swatches; backticked codes are always treated as colors.

### Fixed

- Fixed the terminal hardware cursor disappearing in Ghostty. `resolveHardwareCursorPreference` force-hid the hardware cursor whenever it detected a Ghostty session (to fight bar-cursor afterimage "trails"), but the editor was simultaneously kept in terminal-cursor (marker-only) mode via `getUseTerminalCursorMarker()`, which renders no glyph and relies on the now-hidden hardware cursor — so Ghostty users had no visible caret at all, regardless of `PI_HARDWARE_CURSOR`. The Ghostty/`PI_FORCE_HARDWARE_CURSOR` override and the redundant `useTerminalCursorMarker` state are removed: `showHardwareCursor` is honored as-requested again (hardware cursor on by default), and disabling it cleanly falls back to the steady software-cursor glyph. The per-paint anti-trail mitigations (hide-cursor + autowrap-off inside the synchronized-output block) are retained, which is the actual trail fix.

## [15.5.12] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- Fixed terminal resizes corrupting native scrollback with duplicated rows. The 15.4.0 change that defers a destructive scrollback clear+replay (so a user scrolled into history is not yanked while a streaming tail cell mutates) also caught genuine width/height resizes: a resize reflows the terminal's own committed scrollback at the new geometry, but repainting only the viewport left the stale old-size rows in history, so every overflowed row showed up twice (old-size wrap + new-size copy) when scrolling back, until the next prompt submit cleaned it up. `#planRender` now rebuilds history synchronously when the frame's geometry actually changed (`widthChanged || heightChanged`) via the restored `historyRebuild` intent, and defers the rebuild only for pure content mutations where the user may be reading scrollback mid-stream.

## [15.5.0] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- Fixed `@` file mention autocomplete stalling for seconds when the query references something outside the project root (e.g. `@../`, `@~/`, `@/abs/`). `CombinedAutocompleteProvider` now short-circuits to plain immediate-directory prefix listing in those cases instead of dispatching a recursive `fuzzyFind` walk over a sibling directory full of unrelated projects. Inside-cwd queries keep the existing fuzzy-then-prefix behavior. ([#1395](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1395))
- Gated the Hangul Compatibility Jamo width correction (U+3131..U+318E → 1 cell, originally landed in 15.0.1 for the IME / hardware-cursor displacement bug) behind `process.platform === "darwin"` in the TS path and `cfg!(target_os = "macos")` in the `pi-natives` Rust path. macOS terminals (Ghostty / Terminal.app / iTerm2) render jamo as 1 cell despite UAX#11 classifying them as Wide, but WezTerm and most Linux terminals honor UAX#11 and render them as 2 cells. The unconditional correction therefore desynced the TUI's column bookkeeping from the terminal's actual rendering off-darwin, producing corrupted layout and broken Korean input on Linux. On non-darwin the helpers now defer entirely to `Bun.stringWidth` / `UnicodeWidthStr` (also a small perf win on the multi-char-grapheme path). ([#1410](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1410))

## [15.4.0] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- Fixed terminal scrollback gaining duplicate copies of the welcome screen (and any other header content) when the bottom tool cell mutated across the previous viewport boundary. Once a row scrolls into terminal history it cannot be retracted, so a subsequent shrink that would re-expose that row in the repainted viewport now clears stale scrollback and replays the transcript, then suppresses one immediate suffix-scroll frame so live status/editor chrome is not deposited twice. Multiplexer panes ignore `\x1b[3J`, so the recovery is gated on `!isMultiplexerSession()`.
- Fixed the IME / hardware cursor sticking to the bottom of the terminal after a resize that grew the viewport taller than the rendered transcript. `#emitViewportRepaint` always writes one row per screen line (padding empty rows past the content), so the post-write hardware cursor sits at screen row `height - 1`. The bookkeeping previously clamped the tracked cursor row to `lines.length - 1`, making `#cursorControlSequence`'s relative `rowDelta` underestimate the upward move by `(height - lines.length)` rows and pinning the cursor at the viewport bottom even though the focused component's `CURSOR_MARKER` was on a content row.

## [15.3.2] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- Fixed `matchesKey(data, "ctrl+m")` (and the other named-key collisions: `ctrl+h`/`ctrl+i`/`ctrl+j`/`ctrl+[`) returning true for the bare `\r`/`\x08`/`\t`/`\n`/`\x1b` byte terminals send for Enter/Backspace/Tab/Escape in legacy mode. Binding a command to `Ctrl+M` no longer fires when the user presses Enter — the named key wins, and `ctrl+<colliding-letter>` matches only when the terminal disambiguates via the Kitty keyboard protocol or `modifyOtherKeys`. ([#1354](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1354))
- Fixed full TUI redraws clearing terminal scrollback with `CSI 3 J`, preserving manual scrollback inspection while active sessions continue updating. ([#1295](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1295))

## [15.2.3] - 2026-05-22
### Added

- Added `SettingsList#setItems` to replace the entire settings list with a new items array while automatically clamping selection to a valid index

### Changed

- Updated `Loader` to drive renders at ~60fps (16ms tick) while keeping spinner-frame advancement at 80ms so shimmer/animated message colorizers update smoothly without altering spinner cadence

## [15.1.9] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- Fixed terminal probe responses (DA1, kitty keyboard, Mode 2031) leaking into the prompt as keystrokes when the response is split across stdin reads. `ProcessTerminal` now reassembles `\x1b[?<digits>...` private CSI fragments and dispatches the complete response through the existing pattern handlers. ([#1238](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1238))

## [15.1.4] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- Fixed `renderInlineMarkdown` crashing with `TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'e.replace')` when called with a non-string value during streaming — partial JSON parsing leaves option label fields temporarily unpopulated, causing the ask tool renderer to fail. ([#1176](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1176))

## [15.0.2] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- Restored the `Key` runtime helper on `@oh-my-pi/pi-tui` to mirror upstream `@mariozechner/pi-tui`'s surface. `Key.enter`, `Key.escape`, `Key.tab`, … return the canonical key-name strings; modifier methods (`Key.ctrl(k)`, `Key.shift(k)`, `Key.ctrlShift(k)`, etc.) build precisely-typed `KeyId` literals like `"ctrl+c"`. Pure runtime convenience for typed key-id construction — plugins built against the upstream package surface that import `Key` (e.g. `@plannotator/pi-extension`, `@juicesharp/rpiv-ask-user-question`) load again now that the specifier shim remaps them onto this package.

## [15.0.1] - 2026-05-14
### Breaking Changes

- Increased the minimum required Bun version for the TUI package from >=1.3.7 to >=1.3.14
- Fixed `TerminalInfo.sendNotification` not delivering desktop notifications on macOS. macOS requires per-app notification permission, which terminal emulators (kitty, ghostty, alacritty, …) almost never have, so OSC 9/99 sequences were silently dropped at the OS layer. `sendNotification` now shells out to `alerter` or `terminal-notifier` when either is on `$PATH` (both register their own LSApplication and ship a "Terminal" / `>_` icon). When neither is installed the dispatch is a deliberate no-op + a single `logger.warn` line on the first miss (subsequent dispatches stay silent) so the user can spot the missing binary in `~/.omp/logs/omp.YYYY-MM-DD.log` and `brew install alerter`. Linux/Windows still go through the OSC/Bell path.
- Fixed `TerminalInfo.formatNotification` losing OSC 9/99 desktop notifications when running inside tmux. The OSC sequence is now wrapped in tmux's DCS passthrough envelope (`\ePtmux;…\e\\` with embedded ESC bytes doubled) when `TMUX` is set, so notifications reach the parent terminal. `set -g allow-passthrough on` is still required on the tmux side for the wrapped sequence to be forwarded. Bell-only terminals are unchanged.
- Fixed alerter desktop notifications staying on screen indefinitely. `scripts/mac-alerter.sh` previously passed `--timeout 30` (which makes alerter call `removeDeliveredNotification` after 30 s, also purging the Notification Center entry) and forced Alert-style via `--actions "Open"` (persistent until user click). It now ships Banner-style argv (no `--actions`, no `--timeout`): macOS auto-dismisses the toast after ~10 s and archives the entry to Notification Center for later review. Click-to-focus is preserved through `@CONTENTCLICKED` body clicks. NC archival also requires "Show in Notification Center" enabled for Terminal under macOS System Settings → Notifications.
- Fixed `composeNotificationSubtitle` showing a stale tmux `pane_title` (typically `π: kitty & tmux` or the cwd prefix written before auto-naming runs) instead of the live OMP session name. The OMP-supplied `fallback` is now consulted first for the pane component; the cached tmux pane title is only used when no session name is available. Window name handling is unchanged.
- Fixed `sendDesktopNotification` always routing through `alerter` / `terminal-notifier` on darwin, even for terminals (ghostty / iTerm2 / wezterm) that surface OSC 9 / OSC 99 as native notifications through their own bundle. The dispatch now prefers the OSC path on darwin when the terminal advertises native macOS notification capability; the fallback only kicks in for kitty / alacritty / vscode / unknown shells whose host app isn't a notification-capable bundle. This unblocks the user-controlled per-app notification settings flow for ghostty / iTerm2 / wezterm — toast style, NC archival, and click-to-focus all attach to the terminal app's own System Settings entry rather than to `com.apple.Terminal` (which `alerter` would post under).
- Fixed Korean IME composition leaving a growing horizontal gap between typed jamo and the cursor inside the OMP prompt under tmux + ghostty (and other macOS terminals). `Bun.stringWidth` and the underlying UAX#11 East Asian Width tables classify Hangul Compatibility Jamo (U+3131..U+318E — ㄱ ㄴ ㄷ ㄹ ㅁ ㅂ ㅅ ㅇ ㅈ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ + filler) as Wide (2 cells), but every macOS terminal we ship to (Ghostty / Terminal.app / iTerm2) actually renders them as a single cell in monospace fonts. `#extractCursorPosition` was computing `col = visibleWidth(beforeMarker)` and feeding the doubled value to `\x1b[(col+1)G`, placing the hardware cursor (and therefore the IME candidate window) `N_jamo` cells past the visible glyph — exactly the gap the user saw growing as they typed. `visibleWidthRaw` now subtracts 1 cell for each Compatibility Jamo character, returning the column count macOS terminals actually use. Hangul Syllables (U+AC00..U+D7A3, e.g. `안`) stay at 2 cells in both Bun and the terminal — unaffected. Other CJK widths (Chinese / Japanese / Halfwidth Hangul) are unchanged. NOTE: the Rust `pi-natives` width tables (used by `sliceWithWidth` / `truncateToWidth` / `wrapTextWithAnsi`) also count Compatibility Jamo as 2 cells; truncation and word-wrap on jamo-heavy lines will still be slightly aggressive. The defect is invisible in normal use because the AI composes Korean as syllables, not jamo, and users type syllables once IME composition completes. A follow-up will reconcile the Rust side.
- Fixed a brief black-flash flicker in the TUI when streaming long markdown responses inside tmux (especially noticeable in ghostty with multiple panes open). Root cause: when a markdown fence line above the viewport changed between two streaming tokens (e.g. `` ``` `` → `` ```python ``), `#doRender()` would take the `firstChanged < prevViewportTop` branch and emit `\x1b[2J\x1b[H` (full screen clear + cursor home) wrapped in BSU. The BSU envelope can split across PTY reads, leaving tmux briefly displaying a blank pane before the rest of the buffer arrives — multiplied across panes during repaint. The viewport-above branch now calls a new `viewportRefresh()` helper that does cursor-home + per-line `\x1b[2K` + line content (no `\x1b[2J`), so the visible viewport content is repainted without ever clearing the screen. Scrollback above the viewport may briefly show stale rendering, but only of the SAME lines that just changed — invisible during streaming when the user isn't scrolled up. Other full-redraw paths (resize, first render, etc.) keep the hard `fullRender(true)` behavior unchanged.

### Tests

- Added `test/no-2k-anywhere.test.ts` — lint guard that scans `packages/tui/src/` for `\x1b[2K` string literals outside comments. The earlier streaming-flicker fix re-introduced the BSU-split flash bug by moving `\x1b[2K`-before-content from `fullRender` to `viewportRefresh` (same anti-pattern in a new location). This test catches that class of regression at CI time so future changes can't silently revive it.
- Added `test/render-emit-snapshot.test.ts` — four scenario-based byte-snapshot guards (single-line mutation, streaming append, above-viewport mutation triggering `viewportRefresh`, trailing-line clear on shrink). Asserts structural invariants on the EMITTED BYTES from `terminal.write(…)`: no `\x1b[2K`, no `\x1b[2J`, the new content appears, the BSU close `\x1b[?2026l` is present. Catches render-path changes that achieve the right final viewport state via a transient blank frame (which is exactly how the typing-flicker bug slipped past `render-regressions.test.ts`).
- Added `test/ime-jamo-cursor.test.ts` — six cases asserting the Input component's hardware cursor marker column does not grow at 2× per typed Korean compatibility jamo. Before commit `79e3170c6` typing 14 jamo produced a 14-cell gap between the visible text and the IME candidate window; the test caps the cursor column at `PROMPT_WIDTH + N_jamo` and asserts the per-keystroke delta is at most 1. NOTE: the Rust `pi-natives` `sliceWithWidth` still treats jamo as 2 cells (binary package, follow-up); the test guard accepts a small residual offset but flags the doubling regression.

## [14.9.8] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Added `Terminal.setProgress(active)` to emit OSC 9;4 progress sequences with a ~1s keepalive interval so Ghostty does not clear the indicator during long-running work (ports pi-mono `a900d251` + `76bc605a`)
- Added optional `argumentHint?: string` to `SlashCommand`; rendered before the description in the autocomplete dropdown (ports pi-mono `aa25726e`)
- Added `VirtualTerminal.waitForRender()` test helper for the throttled render pipeline (ports pi-mono `41377ee8`)

### Changed

- `ProcessTerminal` `columns`/`rows` getters consult `Bun.env.COLUMNS` / `Bun.env.LINES` before falling back to 80×24, so piped/non-TTY runs honour environment-provided dimensions (ports pi-mono `32f7fc6a`)
- `requestRender()` non-force calls are coalesced to a ~16ms frame budget; `requestRender(true)` still flushes immediately via `process.nextTick` (ports pi-mono `6f5f37f8`)
- `KNOWN_TERMINALS.base` / `KNOWN_TERMINALS.trueColor` default `hyperlinks: false`; tmux and screen (`TMUX` env or `TERM` starts with `tmux`/`screen`) force `hyperlinks: false` even when the outer terminal would advertise OSC 8 (adapts pi-mono `30a8a41f`)
- `SlashCommand.getArgumentCompletions()` may return a `Promise`; results are now awaited and non-array returns are ignored (ports pi-mono `a1e10789`)
- Fuzzy `@` autocomplete now follows symlinked directories via `ScanOptions.follow_links` plumbed through the native walker (ports pi-mono `780d5367`)
- Plain `@<query>` (no slash) fuzzy matches by basename only, so `@plan` no longer surfaces every file whose ancestor directories contain `plan` (ports pi-mono `968430f6`)

### Fixed

- Fixed editor corruption on Thai Sara Am (U+0E33) and Lao AM (U+0EB3) vowels by normalizing to their compatibility decompositions on the terminal-write path while keeping editor content logically unchanged (ports pi-mono `bc668826` + `338ce3a3` + `20ca45d5`)
- Fixed cell-size detection (`CSI 6;h;w t` response) to consume only exact replies, so a bare `Escape` keystroke is no longer swallowed while waiting for terminal image metadata (ports pi-mono `49c0d860`)
- Fixed Kitty CSI-u printable input duplicating on layouts (e.g. Italian) where the terminal also emits the raw character: the immediately-following matching codepoint is now suppressed (ports pi-mono `bdb416cb`)
- Fixed bracketed-paste CSI-u `Ctrl+<letter>` re-encoding (tmux popup with `extended-keys-format=csi-u`) leaking literal `[<code>;5u` into the editor; control bytes are decoded back to their literal byte before per-char filtering (ports pi-mono `d06db09a`)
- Fixed xterm `modifyOtherKeys` shifted printable input so uppercase letters inserted via `CSI 27;mod;codepoint~` reach the editor correctly (ports pi-mono `6b55d685`)
- Fixed `super`-modified Kitty shortcuts (`super+k`, `ctrl+super+enter`, …) to parse and match via the new `KITTY_MOD_SUPER` mask (ports pi-mono `ddb8454c` + `5ed46003`)
- Fixed `ctrl+alt+<letter>` in tmux falling through to CSI-u / `modifyOtherKeys` when the legacy `ESC<ctrl-char>` form does not match (ports pi-mono `6cf5098f`)
- Fixed Markdown strikethrough requiring strict `~~text~~` delimiters with non-whitespace boundaries; single tildes no longer render strikethrough (ports pi-mono `db5274b4`)

- Allowed `SlashCommand.getArgumentCompletions` to return asynchronous results by accepting Promise-based completions
- Added `argumentHint` support to slash command definitions and displayed it in command suggestion descriptions
- Added support for xterm `modifyOtherKeys` printable key sequences by decoding `CSI 27;mod;key~` into text input

### Changed

- Changed slash-command autocomplete list rendering to combine command hint and description in a single displayed suggestion text
- Changed render scheduling to throttle `requestRender` calls to roughly 60fps by batching updates
- Changed terminal input handling to process complete cell-size responses without buffering partial input
- Changed `KeyId` to accept super-modifier combinations and improve typed key-id validation

### Fixed

- Normalized line output during rendering to correct Thai/Lao AM glyph composition for displayed text
- Fixed duplicated Kitty key input emissions by dropping the matching unmodified follow-up sequence after a Kitty CSI-u printable-key event

## [14.9.5] - 2026-05-12
### Fixed

- Fixed rapidly blinking cursor artifact during task execution by consolidating cursor control sequences into the synchronized output buffer ([#992](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/992))

## [14.5.7] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- Fixed editor Ctrl+Enter handling to recognize NumLock and keypad Enter variants.

## [14.3.0] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- Fixed shared Markdown Mermaid fenced-block rendering to resolve diagrams from fenced source text instead of external prerender state

## [14.1.1] - 2026-04-14

### Breaking Changes

- Removed the `searchDb` constructor argument from `CombinedAutocompleteProvider`, requiring callers to use the built-in search behavior

### Changed

- Changed truncation debug logging to run only when `debugRedraw` is enabled

### Fixed

- Fixed viewport jumping during streaming and session swap by tracking actual content height instead of high-water mark

## [14.0.5] - 2026-04-11

### Changed

- Updated hash computation to use `Bun.hash()` instead of `Bun.hash.xxHash64()`, which may return `number` in addition to `bigint`
- Simplified cache key computation in Box component by removing intermediate hash updates and consolidating hash operations
- Wrapped native text utility functions (`sliceWithWidth`, `truncateToWidth`, `wrapTextWithAnsi`, `extractSegments`) to automatically pass the current default tab width, simplifying the API for consumers
- Added `getIndentationNoescape` wrapper that uses `process.cwd()` as the project root for relative file paths
- Re-export `getDefaultTabWidth`, `getIndentation`, and `setDefaultTabWidth` from `@oh-my-pi/pi-utils`; native text helpers still receive tab width via wrappers that read the JS default

## [13.16.1] - 2026-03-27

### Added

- Support for optional SearchDb parameter in CombinedAutocompleteProvider constructor for improved fuzzy search performance
- Fuzzy matching filter for autocomplete suggestions to improve relevance of results

### Changed

- Fuzzy discovery now applies fuzzy matching filter to results for improved relevance of autocomplete suggestions
- Autocomplete fuzzy discovery now accepts optional SearchDb instance for faster searches

## [13.16.0] - 2026-03-27
### Changed

- Updated tab replacement in editor text sanitization to respect configured tab width setting

## [13.15.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- Added `renderInlineMarkdown()` function to render inline markdown (bold, italic, code, links, strikethrough) to styled strings

### Fixed

- Fixed editor consuming user-rebound copy keys, preventing custom keybindings from working in the editor

## [13.14.1] - 2026-03-21
### Added

- Added Ctrl+_ as an additional default shortcut for undo

### Fixed

- Ensured undo functionality respects user-configured keybindings

## [13.12.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- Added `moveToMessageStart()` and `moveToMessageEnd()` methods to move cursor to the beginning and end of the entire message

### Fixed

- Fixed autocomplete to preserve `./` prefix when completing relative file and directory paths
- Fixed paste marker expansion to handle special regex replacement tokens ($1, $2, $&, $$, $`, $') literally in pasted content

## [13.11.0] - 2026-03-12
### Fixed

- Fixed OSC 11 background color detection to correctly handle partial escape sequences that arrive mid-buffer, preventing user input from being swallowed
- Fixed race condition where overlapping OSC 11 queries would be incorrectly cancelled by DA1 sentinels from previous queries

## [13.7.5] - 2026-03-04
### Changed

- Extracted word navigation logic into reusable `moveWordLeft` and `moveWordRight` utility functions for consistent cursor movement across components

## [13.6.2] - 2026-03-03
### Fixed

- Fixed cursor positioning when content shrinks to empty without clearOnShrink enabled

## [13.5.4] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- Fixed viewport repaint scrollback accounting during resize oscillation to avoid double-scrolling on height shrink and added exact-row scrollback assertions in overlay regression coverage ([#228](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/228), [#234](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/234))
## [13.5.3] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- Fixed append rendering logic to correctly handle offscreen header changes during content overflow growth, preserving scroll history integrity
- Fixed visible tail line updates when appending new content during viewport overflow conditions
- Fixed cursor positioning instability when appending content under external cursor relocation by using absolute screen addressing instead of relative cursor movement

## [13.5.2] - 2026-03-01
### Breaking Changes

- Removed `getMermaidImage` callback from MarkdownTheme; replaced with `getMermaidAscii` that accepts ASCII string instead of image data
- Removed mermaid module exports (`renderMermaidToPng`, `extractMermaidBlocks`, `prerenderMermaidBlocks`, `MermaidImage` interface)

### Changed

- Mermaid diagrams now render as ASCII text instead of terminal graphics protocol images

## [13.5.1] - 2026-03-01
### Fixed

- Fixed viewport shift handling to prevent stale content when mixed updates remap screen rows

## [13.5.0] - 2026-03-01

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `PI_TUI_RESIZE_CLEAR_STRATEGY`; resize behavior is no longer configurable between viewport/scrollback modes. The renderer now uses fixed semantics: width changes perform a hard reset (`3J` + full content rewrite), while height changes and diff fallbacks use viewport-scoped repainting.

### Added

- Added a new terminal regression suite in `packages/tui/test/render-regressions.test.ts` covering no-op render stability, targeted middle-line diffs, shrink cleanup, width-resize truncation without ghost rows, shrink/grow viewport tail anchoring, scrollback deduplication across forced redraws, overlay restore behavior, and rapid mutation convergence.
- Expanded `packages/tui/test/overlay-scroll.test.ts` with stress coverage for overflow shrink/regrow cycles, resize oscillation, overlay toggle churn, no-op render loops, and hardware-cursor-only updates while bounding scrollback growth and blank-run artifacts.

### Changed

- Refactored render orchestration to explicit `hardReset` and `viewportRepaint` paths, with targeted fallbacks for offscreen diff ranges and unsafe row deltas.
- Switched startup to `requestRender(true)` so the first frame always initializes renderer state with a forced full path.
- Replaced legacy viewport bookkeeping (`previousViewportTop`) with `viewportTopRow` tracking and consistent screen-relative cursor calculations.
- Updated stop-sequence cursor placement to target the visible working area and clamp to terminal bounds before final newline emission.
- Documented the intentional performance policy of not forcing full repaint on every viewport-top shift, relying on narrower safety guards instead.

### Fixed

- Fixed stale/duplicated terminal cursor dedup state by synchronizing `#lastCursorSequence` in all render write paths (hard reset, viewport repaint, deleted-lines clear path, append fast path, and differential path).
- Fixed scroll overshoot on `stop()` when content fills the viewport by clamping target row movement to valid screen rows.
