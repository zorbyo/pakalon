# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [15.7.0] - 2026-05-31
### Added

- Added `blockRangeAt` native API along with `BlockRange` and `BlockRangeOptions` types to return the 1-indexed line span of the outermost tree-sitter node beginning on a given line

### Fixed

- Fixed an interactive shell inside a **pipeline** (`zsh -i ... | awk`, `time zsh -i | cat`, etc.) suspending the embedded host with `suspended (tty input)`. The earlier embedded-host fix `setsid`-detached external children so they could not seize the host's controlling tty, but carved pipeline stages out because a later stage that `setpgid`-joined a detached leader failed with EPERM — leaving every pipeline stage in the host session, where an interactive child opened `/dev/tty`, `tcsetpgrp`'d itself to the foreground, and stopped the host (OMP) on its next tty read. `pi_shell` now detaches pipeline stages too: `child_session_action` returns `DetachSession` for any non-terminal-stdin child regardless of pipeline membership, and `execute_external_command` skips `process_group(...)` entirely for detached children so no cross-session `setpgid` is attempted. Pipeline stages no longer share one process group, which the embedded host does not rely on (cancellation walks the descendant tree and pipes are session-independent).

## [15.6.0] - 2026-05-30

### Changed

- Changed npm publishing to ship `@oh-my-pi/pi-natives` as a small core loader package plus per-platform optional dependency leaf packages, so installs fetch only the host platform's native addon instead of every supported `.node` binary.

## [15.5.10] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- Fixed background bash jobs pinning the JS main thread at ~200% CPU when the child process emits output in many tiny writes (printf-style progress, llama-cli token streams). `pi_shell`'s pipe reader forwarded every chunk through a separate `ThreadsafeFunction::call` per kernel `read(2)`, so a chatty child produced millions of cross-thread napi callbacks that the JS main thread had to drain serially — even after the child exited, the queue kept the process saturated for seconds. The bridge now greedily coalesces every chunk already in the mpsc queue into a single batched call (capped at 64 KiB) before crossing into JS, collapsing 1-byte writes into one napi dispatch and bringing the steady-state callback rate back to the JS event-loop's throughput.

## [15.5.9] - 2026-05-28
### Changed

- Changed native addon extraction to skip re-extracting cached `.node` files when their size already matches embedded archive metadata
- Changed standalone binaries to embed native addons as a compressed tarball and unpack them into the versioned native cache on first run instead of embedding each `.node` file uncompressed.

### Fixed

- Fixed CI native addon builds retaining ELF debug and symbol sections in release artifacts; stripped builds are now verified to reject `.debug_*`, `.zdebug_*`, `.symtab`, and `.strtab` sections.

### Security

- Hardened embedded addon archive extraction by rejecting unsafe entry names and non-file archive entries before writing binaries to disk

## [15.5.4] - 2026-05-27
### Added

- Added `Hashline` class with methods to format headers, parse/apply hashline edits, split inputs, compute diffs, generate previews, and recover from stale hashes
- Added `HashlineChunker` class to stream UTF-8 text into numbered hashline chunks incrementally
- Added `HashlineCursorKind`, `HashlineEditKind`, and `HashlineTokenKind` exports for hashline cursor/edit/token discrimination
- Added `unfoldUntilLines` and `unfoldLimitLines` options to `SummaryOptions` to control BFS unfold visibility with an optional hard cap

## [15.5.0] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- Fixed bash heredocs (`<<`) and here-strings (`<<<`) deadlocking the shell on Windows past ~4 KiB and on macOS past 16-64 KiB. `brush_core::interp::setup_open_file_with_contents` wrote the entire body into an anonymous pipe synchronously before handing the reader to the next command; once the body exceeded the OS pipe buffer the writer blocked forever and the `bash` tool timed out at the hard 305 s ceiling without ever launching the consumer. The Linux fast path still uses `F_SETPIPE_SZ` to grow the pipe in-place; every other OS-threaded platform (and Linux bodies above `pipe-max-size`) now decouples the write onto a fire-and-forget thread that terminates naturally on drain or `BrokenPipe`; no-thread targets keep the upstream synchronous path so heredocs do not fail at thread spawn.

## [15.3.2] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- Fixed `matchesKey` claiming `ctrl+m`/`ctrl+j`/`ctrl+i`/`ctrl+h`/`ctrl+[` for the single bytes terminals emit for Enter/Tab/Backspace/Escape in legacy mode. Pressing Enter no longer triggers a `ctrl+m` binding; the named keys now own those bytes and the colliding `ctrl+<letter>` combinations only match when the terminal disambiguates via the Kitty keyboard protocol or `modifyOtherKeys`. The same gate now also applies to `ctrl+alt+<letter>` legacy `ESC + <ctrl-char>` sequences (e.g. `\x1b\r` is Alt+Enter, not Ctrl+Alt+M). ([#1354](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1354))

## [15.0.2] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- Added a per-release version sentinel napi export (`__piNativesV{major}_{minor}_{patch}`). The Rust `js_name` is bumped in lock-step with the package version by `scripts/release.ts`; the JS loader computes the expected name from `package.json#version` and throws an actionable error when the on-disk `.node` doesn't expose it. This converts the silent `<sym> is not a function` crash from a stale addon into a load-time failure pointing at the real fix.
- Added `applyBashFixups(command)` — a synchronous brush-parser-driven rewrite that strips trailing `| head|tail …`, redundant `2>&1`, and the `|&` shorthand from top-level pipelines, returning `{ command, stripped }`. Replaces the hand-rolled top-level mask scanner in `pi-coding-agent`; tokenization, quoting, heredocs, command substitution, and nested compound commands are now handled by the real shell AST instead of regex/character-walking. Lives in `pi_shell::fixup` on the Rust side.

### Fixed

- Fixed `<sym> is not a function` crashes on Windows after `bun install -g @oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent` updates while an `omp` process was running. Bun cannot overwrite a locked `node_modules/@oh-my-pi/pi-natives/native/pi_natives.win32-x64.node` and silently keeps the old binary alongside the new ESM wrapper, so the next launch loads mismatched code. The loader now mirrors the addon into `~/.omp/natives/<version>/` on Windows npm installs and prefers that copy at load time — each version gets its own filesystem path, so future updates land in `node_modules` unchallenged. The new version sentinel detects any remaining drift up front.

### Fixed

- Fixed `$env:NAME` PowerShell references being collapsed to `:NAME` when brush forwarded a command to a PowerShell (or any) subprocess. `pi-shell` now defines `env=$env` as a non-exported global on every brush session so the bash parameter expansion of `$env` yields the literal `$env`, leaving `$env:NAME` intact. User-driven assignments (`env=prod`) push their own command-scope binding and shadow the fallback, preserving the bash POSIX contract. ([#1079](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/1079))

## [15.0.1] - 2026-05-14
### Breaking Changes

- Raised the minimum required Bun runtime version to >=1.3.14
- Removed `PhotonImage` class, `ImageFormat` enum, and `SamplingFilter` enum from native exports. General-purpose image decode/resize/encode now uses [`Bun.Image`](https://bun.com/docs/runtime/image), which ships in Bun 1.3.14+ with statically-linked libjpeg-turbo, libspng, and libwebp plus SIMD geometry kernels — same operations, zero native-addon footprint. `encodeSixel` stays (no Bun equivalent for the SIXEL terminal protocol).
- Removed `webp` Rust workspace dependency along with `PhotonImage`'s WebP encoder.

## [14.9.9] - 2026-05-12
### Breaking Changes

- Removed `projfsOverlayProbe`, `projfsOverlayStart`, and `projfsOverlayStop` overlays APIs and `ProjfsOverlayProbeResult` type from the public natives interface

### Added

- Added unified isolation APIs `isoBackend`, `isoProbe`, `isoResolve`, `isoStart`, `isoStop`, `isoDiff`, and `isoIsUnavailableError` for selecting, probing, resolving, starting, stopping, and diffing isolated filesystems
- Added `IsoBackendKind`, `IsoChangeKind`, `IsoDiff`, `IsoFileChange`, `IsoProbeResult`, and `IsoResolveResult` type exports to describe isolation backend capabilities and diff outcomes

### Changed

- Changed `native` exports to remove the platform-specific ProjFS-only overlay surface in favor of generic isolation controls

## [14.9.5] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- Fixed shell cancellation occasionally killing the harness. The `pi_shell` descendant tracker harvested every descendant's `pgid` into the kill set, so any subprocess that inherited the harness's pgid (any helper spawned via APIs that do not call `setpgid` — sibling LSP/MCP processes, etc.) dragged `harness.pgid` into the list and the follow-up `kill(-harness.pgid, SIGTERM)` terminated the harness alongside the targets. The classifier now only adopts a `pgid` when its leader is itself one of the new descendants, and `kill_process_group` refuses the harness's own process group as a last-line defense.
- Fixed macOS process-tree termination silently doing nothing. The descendant walk relied on `proc_listchildpids`, which on recent darwin kernels (25.4+) returns no entries when a process queries its own children, so `Process::descendants` came back empty and tree-kill cleanup never reached grandchildren. The walk now builds a one-shot `ppid → [pid]` map from `proc_listallpids` + `proc_pidinfo`, matching the approach already used by `find_by_path` and the Windows Toolhelp path.

### Changed

- Removed the 20 Hz background descendant tracker that scanned the harness's process tree for the entire lifetime of every shell command. Cancellation now does a small rescan-and-signal loop on demand (up to three waves — SIGTERM, then SIGKILL, then SIGKILL — with early exit as soon as no descendants remain). The previous tracker existed to pin process identities against PID reuse races, but `Process::from_pid` already pins identity by kernel start time / pidfd, so the constant scanning paid for nothing and added meaningful syscall load on macOS where each scan now does `proc_listallpids` + `proc_pidinfo` per pid.

## [14.9.3] - 2026-05-10
### Added

- Added `idle`, `system`, and `user` options to `MacOSPowerAssertion` so callers can request specific macOS sleep-prevention modes (`caffeinate -i`, `-s`, and `-u`) in addition to the existing `display` option
- Added support for combining multiple macOS power assertion flags in a single `MacOSPowerAssertion` handle

### Changed

- Changed `MacOSPowerAssertion.stop()` documentation to indicate it releases all held assertions and is safe to call repeatedly as a no-op

## [14.9.2] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- Added `listWorkspace`, a native single-pass workspace walker that returns bounded tree entries and AGENTS.md directory-context candidates together.

## [14.7.1] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- Added `size` property to `GlobMatch` for regular files to expose their byte size

### Changed

- Sped up native `grep` files-with-matches searches by stopping after the first match per file, reading small files without mmap overhead, and relying on grep-searcher binary detection instead of a separate full-file NUL scan.

### Fixed

- Fixed native `grep` `filesWithMatches` mode so `totalMatches` reports the number of matching files rather than line-match totals
- Fixed native `grep` count-mode limits applying to files instead of matches, and restored timeout/abort cancellation checks for small native filesystem scans.

## [14.7.0] - 2026-05-04
### Added

- Added `summarizeCode` function to expose native code summarization with `kind`, `startLine`, `endLine`, and optional `text` segments plus parse/elision metadata
- Added `minBodyLines` and `minCommentLines` options to `summarizeCode` to control when function/body and multiline comment elision is applied
- Added `SummaryOptions` and `SummaryResult` TypeScript definitions for typed `summarizeCode` input and output

## [14.6.1] - 2026-05-02
### Changed

- Changed the native package loader from CommonJS analyzer-visible assignments to a template-rendered ESM entry point with explicit named exports

## [14.5.13] - 2026-05-01
### Changed

- Stopped overriding `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` with an internal `target/napi-build/...` directory during native builds, so Cargo now uses the default or caller-provided target directory
- Simplified native build profile suffix formatting without changing `local` and `ci` values
- Changed the native build output behavior to avoid setting an isolated Cargo target directory automatically

### Removed

- Removed the host Zig CPU contract wrapper (`zig-safe-wrapper.ts`) and its `ZIG`/`PI_NATIVE_REAL_ZIG`/`PI_NATIVE_ZIG_TARGET`/`PI_NATIVE_ZIG_CPU` env handling, since the `zlob` Rust dependency that required Zig is gone
- Removed the `ci-release-verify-natives` script and its AVX-512 marker scan from the release pipeline

## [14.5.12] - 2026-04-30
### Breaking Changes

- Changed `waitForExit` to accept a single options object instead of a numeric timeout argument

### Added

- Added a `signal` option to `terminate` for cancelling termination while waiting for process shutdown
- Added abort `signal` support to `waitForExit` via `ProcessWaitOptions`
- Added a `ProcessWaitOptions` type and updated `waitForExit` to accept an options object

## [14.5.9] - 2026-04-30
### Fixed

## [14.5.6] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- Added shell minimizer support for CMake, CTest, Ninja, GoogleTest binaries, and Bun/Bunx wrappers that run those tools

## [14.5.2] - 2026-04-26
### Changed

- Changed local native build profile from `dev` to `local` for non-CI builds, updating the profile used by the build and local build output label

### Removed

- Removed the `chunk` napi module (`ChunkState`, chunk schema, chunk rendering, chunk edit) and dropped `generate_chunk_schema()` from the build script

## [14.3.0] - 2026-04-25
### Added

- Added `text` to `MinimizerResult` so consumers can replace rewritten output with the minimized replacement text
- Added `settingsHash` to `MinimizerOptions` to verify the minimizer `settingsPath` contents against a xxHash64 digest before applying them
- Added `minimized` output telemetry via `MinimizerResult` on `ShellExecuteResult` and `ShellRunResult`, exposing the applied minimizer filter and original/minimized byte counts when output is rewritten
- Added a new `minimizer` option to `ShellExecuteOptions` and `ShellOptions` to configure per-command output minimization
- Added the `MinimizerOptions` API with controls for enabling minimization, overriding settings via `settingsPath`, allow/deny lists (`only`, `except`), and `maxCaptureBytes` capture limits

### Changed

- Changed the shell output minimizer to more aggressively compact successful test runs, git output, large listings, grep/find results, source reads, and dependency manifests
- Changed compound and piped shell commands to bypass output minimization entirely, keeping minimization limited to eligible whole-command output after the command exits

### Fixed

- Fixed chunk edit batches so later operations can reuse an initially validated checksum after an earlier operation changes that same chunk

### Removed

- Removed `PI_DEV` loader diagnostic env var and associated console logging in the native addon loader

### Security

- Added trust-gated loading for minimizer settings by requiring a matching `settingsHash` before accepting a settings file

## [14.2.0] - 2026-04-23

- Updated `ChunkEditOp` documentation to reflect region-scoped semantics — operations now target specific regions rather than chunk structure positions
- Changed `ChunkEditOp.Replace` documentation to clarify substring replacement via `find` parameter instead of line-based replacement
- Changed `EditOperation` interface to use `find` parameter for scoped find/replace operations instead of `line` and `endLine` parameters
- Changed `EditParams` documentation to remove mention of scheduling reordering for line-scoped groups

- Replaced `AstReplaceOptions.pattern` and `rewrite` with single `rewrites` option (Record<string, string>)

### Added

- `astGrep` now accepts multiple patterns in a single call; results from all patterns are merged and sorted by file path then position before offset/limit are applied
- `astEdit` now accepts a `rewrites` map (`Record<string, string>`) and applies all patterns per file in a single pass, compiling them once upfront
- Result ordering in `astGrep` is now deterministic: sorted by path, line, column using `BTreeSet`/`BTreeMap`
