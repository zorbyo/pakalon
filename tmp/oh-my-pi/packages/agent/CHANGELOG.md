# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [15.7.3] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- Added `shake` compaction primitives (`collectShakeRegions`, `applyShakeRegion`, `applyShakeRegions`, `summarizeShakeRegions`, `DEFAULT_SHAKE_CONFIG`, `AGGRESSIVE_SHAKE_CONFIG`, plus the `ShakeRegion`/`ShakeConfig`/`ShakeSummaryItem`/`ShakeSummaryComplete`/`ProtectedToolMatcher` types) under `@oh-my-pi/pi-agent-core/compaction`. These detect heavy context regions — whole tool-call results plus large fenced/XML blocks — and either elide them with placeholders or extractively compress them through an injected completion backend (no LLM summary cut-point). The compressor is provider-agnostic: callers wire it to a local on-device model. Pure detection/mutation; no I/O.

### Fixed

- Fixed tool-output pruning and shake protection for `read`: ordinary file/URL reads are now eligible for compaction, while `read` calls whose `path` starts with `skill://` remain protected like native `skill` results.

## [15.5.15] - 2026-05-30
### Added

- Added `maxToolCallsPerTurn` to `AgentLoopConfig`/`AgentOptions`, allowing callers to cut a streamed assistant turn after a completed tool-call batch and execute the runnable partial turn instead of waiting for the provider to yield.

### Fixed

- Normalized `maxToolCallsPerTurn` to accept only positive integer limits, with non-finite or non-positive values treated as disabled

## [15.5.14] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- Fixed the agent loop abandoning tool calls that Anthropic adaptive/interleaved-thinking models (e.g. Opus) emit under `stop_reason: "end_turn"`. The previous gate only ran tools when `stopReason === "toolUse"`, so an `end_turn`+tool_use turn produced "Tool call was not executed because the assistant ended its turn" placeholders, made no progress, and could trap the model in a re-emit/abandon loop. `stop_reason` is never replayed on the wire and (verified against the live Anthropic Messages API) does not gate continuation validity, so `stop`/`end_turn` turns carrying tool_use blocks are now executed and the loop continues — exactly like `toolUse`. Only `length` (max_tokens truncation) still abandons, since the trailing tool call may have incomplete arguments. The continuation stays valid because `transformMessages` strips the now-untrustworthy thinking signature and the encoder downgrades the block to text.

## [15.5.10] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- Fixed compaction summarizer throws losing the provider's HTTP status. `generateSummary`, `generateHandoff`, `generateShortSummary`, and `generateTurnPrefixSummary` now route their `stopReason === "error"` throws through a `createSummarizationError` helper that copies `AssistantMessage.errorStatus` onto the thrown `Error` as `.status`, letting downstream consumers (e.g. `AgentSession.#isCompactionAuthFailure` in `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent`) branch on real provider 401/403s without regex-scraping the message body.

### Changed

- Changed `Agent.appendMessage`, `popMessage`, `clearMessages`, and `reset` to mutate `state.messages` and `state.pendingToolCalls` in place instead of allocating a fresh array/Set on every transition. Subscribers that capture `state.messages` by reference now observe updates without needing to re-read `state` after each event. The public type signature is unchanged (always `AgentMessage[]` / `Set<string>`).

## [15.5.0] - 2026-05-26
### Added

- Added `approval` support to `AgentTool` declarations with the new `ToolTier` and `ToolApproval` APIs, allowing tools to declare capability tiers (`read`, `write`, or `exec`) and optional override/reason metadata for approval gating
- Added `formatApprovalDetails` on `AgentTool` to append custom detail text or lines to approval prompts
- Added exported `ToolTier` and `ToolApproval` type aliases for tool approval declarations

### Fixed

- Fixed chat-request telemetry storing the raw scoped `serviceTier` value (`"openai-only"`/`"claude-only"`) in `OpenAIAttr.RequestServiceTier` instead of the resolved wire value (`"priority"`). Dashboards and alerts filtering on the concrete tier name (`service_tier == "priority"`) were broken by the scoped placeholder; `buildChatRequestAttributes` now runs the tier through `resolveServiceTier(serviceTier, provider)` before recording, keeping the `shouldSendServiceTier` gate intact so non-OpenAI providers continue to omit the attribute entirely.

## [15.3.0] - 2026-05-25
### Fixed

- Fixed `transformContext` receiving the loop config object as the `signal` argument instead of the actual `AbortSignal`, so hooks that check `signal.aborted` or call `signal.addEventListener` now work correctly under abort/timeout conditions
- Fixed `appendOnlyContext` not being re-evaluated after `setModel()` — the mode was decided once at session construction based on the initial model's provider, so switching from/to DeepSeek (or changing `provider.appendOnlyContext`) mid-session produced incorrect mode behavior

## [15.2.3] - 2026-05-22
### Added

- Added `onBeforeYield` hook support so user code can run right before the agent loop checks for follow-up messages

## [15.1.3] - 2026-05-17
### Added

- Added optional `telemetry` support to `generateSummary`, `generateHandoff`, `generateBranchSummary`, and `compact` options so compaction, handoff, and branch summary one-shot LLM calls can emit OpenTelemetry chat telemetry when enabled
- Added shared oneshot telemetry instrumentation for compaction, handoff, and branch summary calls, tagging spans with `pi.gen_ai.oneshot.kind` values such as `compaction_summary`, `compaction_short_summary`, `compaction_turn_prefix`, `handoff`, and `branch_summary`

## [15.1.2] - 2026-05-15
### Added

- Added `responseHeaders` to `ChatUsageEvent` and `ManualChatTelemetryOptions` so telemetry hooks receive captured lowercase upstream response headers for each chat span
- Added automatic gateway/proxy detection from response headers (`litellm`, `helicone`, `portkey`, `openrouter`) and stamped `pi.gen_ai.gateway.*` span attributes for detected routing metadata
- Added exported `detectGatewayFromHeaders` API for header-based gateway detection

## [15.1.0] - 2026-05-15
### Breaking Changes

- Removed the `@oh-my-pi/pi-agent-core/compaction/handoff` exports from the package surface, including `extractHandoffDocument`, `createHandoffContext`, and `createHandoffFileName`
- Removed legacy telemetry constants from the public enum surface (including `AGGREGATE_ATTR`, `GenAIAttr.System`, and old `gen_ai.*` extension keys such as `gen_ai.request.service_tier`/cost/tool status/handoff fields) and replaced them with `OpenAIAttr`, `PiGenAIAttr`, and `PiGenAIAggregateAttr`

### Added

- Added `generateHandoff(messages, model, apiKey, options)` to `@oh-my-pi/pi-agent-core/compaction` to generate a handoff document by calling the model directly, using live system/tool context and optional metadata
- Added generation filtering so the returned handoff document now includes only text content blocks from the model output
- Added support for defining `AgentTool` schemas with Zod, with legacy TypeBox schemas still supported when generating tool schemas for model calls
- Added `OpenAIAttr`, `PiGenAIAttr`, and `PiGenAIAggregateAttr` exports so consumers can reference the new `openai.*` and `pi.gen_ai.*` telemetry attribute keys directly
- Added `onChatUsage` to `AgentTelemetryConfig`, an always-fired hook receiving a `ChatUsageEvent` for every chat step that produced usage. The event carries the chat `span`, `agent`, `conversationId`, `stepNumber`, `model`, `provider`, `serviceTier`, `usage`, optional `cost`, and resolved dynamic `attributes` — independent of whether a `costEstimator` is configured.
- Added `agentLoopDetailed(...)` and `agentLoopContinueDetailed(...)` helpers that return the same event stream plus a `detailed()` result with run `telemetry` and `coverage`
- Added `onRunEnd` to `AgentTelemetryConfig` to receive `AgentRunSummary` and `AgentRunCoverage` at the end of each invocation
- Added run-level telemetry and coverage types/helpers (for example `AgentRunSummary`, `AgentRunCoverage`, `aggregateAgentRunSummaries`, and `aggregateAgentRunCoverage`) to package exports
- Added generic telemetry extension hooks for dynamic span attributes, provider/agent-name normalization, per-step cost deltas, warning callbacks, bounded summary content capture, and manual chat telemetry for non-loop model calls.
- Added opt-in OpenTelemetry instrumentation on the agent loop. Pass `telemetry: {}` (or a richer `AgentTelemetryConfig`) on `AgentLoopConfig` / `AgentOptions` / `createAgentSession({ telemetry })` to emit GenAI-semantic-convention spans plus `pi.gen_ai.*` extension attributes:
- `invoke_agent {agent.name}` wraps each `agentLoop` invocation with `gen_ai.operation.name=invoke_agent`, agent identity, conversation id, and `pi.gen_ai.agent.step.count`.
- `chat {model}` per provider call, parented under `invoke_agent`, with OTEL request/response/usage attributes (`gen_ai.request.{model,stream,temperature,top_p,top_k,max_tokens,presence_penalty,stop_sequences}`, `gen_ai.response.{model,id,finish_reasons,time_to_first_chunk}`, `gen_ai.usage.{input_tokens,output_tokens,cache_read.input_tokens,cache_creation.input_tokens,reasoning.output_tokens}`) and project extensions for reasoning effort, tool choice, available tools, usage totals, and cost.
- `execute_tool {tool.name}` per tool call, parented under `invoke_agent`, with `gen_ai.tool.{name,call.id,description,type}` plus the active context so user/MCP/provider spans created inside `tool.execute()` attach as children.
- One-shot `handoff` span available via the public `recordHandoff(...)` helper for agent-to-agent transitions.
- Added `AgentTelemetryConfig` hooks (`onSpanStart`, `onSpanEnd`, `costEstimator`), `agent` identity, `attributes` envelope merged onto every span, `captureMessageContent` toggle (defaults to the `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT` env var) emitting OTEL-shaped `gen_ai.input.messages` / `gen_ai.output.messages` / `gen_ai.system_instructions` / `gen_ai.tool.call.arguments` / `gen_ai.tool.call.result`, and tracer/tracerName override surfaces.
- Added `Agent#setTelemetry(config)` so consumers can swap or disable instrumentation between invocations.
- Added `@opentelemetry/api` as a runtime dependency; SDK setup (exporters, samplers, processors) remains the host's responsibility per standard OTEL conventions. When no SDK is registered, helpers fall through to no-op spans with zero overhead.
- Added compaction APIs under `@oh-my-pi/pi-agent-core/compaction`, including context compaction, branch summarization, handoff prompt/context helpers, pruning, token budgeting, prompt templates, and OpenAI `/responses/compact` helpers.

### Changed

- Changed handoff document generation to force `toolChoice: "none"` when calling the model so tool invocation is disabled during generation
- Changed `chat` spans to emit normalized provider identifiers in `gen_ai.provider.name` via OTEL-style values (for example `google` to `gcp.gemini`) instead of the legacy `gen_ai.system` label
- Changed service-tier telemetry to emit `openai.request.service_tier`/`openai.response.service_tier` only when supported by provider via `shouldSendServiceTier`, rather than always using `gen_ai.request.service_tier`
- Changed captured message payloads so full capture now records OTEL-structured message parts with `pi.gen_ai.request.messages`, `pi.gen_ai.system_instructions`, and `gen_ai.output.messages` including assistant `finish_reason`
- Changed the `agent_end` event payload to include optional `telemetry` and `coverage` fields when telemetry is enabled, while keeping the legacy payload shape when disabled
- Changed `invoke_agent` spans to include aggregate `pi.gen_ai.agent.*` attributes for chat/tool counts, latency, usage, cost, errors, and tool coverage

### Fixed

- Fixed intent-field injection for tool schemas defined with Zod by converting them to wire schema before mutation
- Fixed token accounting in `ChatUsageEvent` and usage summaries so `inputTokens` and `totalTokens` now include cached read/write input tokens
- Fixed `execute_tool` span attributes so `pi.gen_ai.tool.status` and `error.type` now reflect run-level tool outcomes (`ok`, `error`, `skipped`, `blocked`, `timeout`, `aborted`) instead of mapping all non-ok cases the same way
- Fixed `onRunEnd` callbacks to be safe and idempotent by invoking them once per run and swallowing thrown callback errors so they cannot fail or duplicate successful runs
- Fixed run telemetry to count interrupted, blocked, or otherwise skipped tool calls so run coverage and tool counters now include those paths
- Fixed chat failure handling so failed chat steps are still represented in run summaries when provider streaming throws before yielding an assistant message
- Fixed double-counting of interrupted tool calls in run summaries: the `runTool` early-return on a queued steering interrupt now defers to the post-batch tail sweep so each call is recorded exactly once
- Fixed `coverage.toolsInvoked` and run-summary tool counters under-reporting tool calls embedded in an aborted/errored assistant message — those calls now record a collector orphan with status `aborted` or `error`
- Fixed `AgentRunSummary.usage.inputTokens` so it now includes `cache_read` and `cache_write` input tokens, matching `ChatUsageEvent.inputTokens`
- Fixed span lifecycle hooks (`onSpanStart`, `onSpanEnd`) so a thrown user callback is caught and surfaced via `onTelemetryWarning` (`on_span_start_failed` / `on_span_end_failed`) instead of leaking and aborting the surrounding span
- Fixed unbounded recursion in summary content capture when a captured value contains a cyclic or deeply nested array — array recursion now respects the same depth cap as plain-object recursion and replaces back-references with `"[Circular]"`

## [15.0.1] - 2026-05-14
### Breaking Changes

- Raised the minimum required Bun version from >=1.3.7 to >=1.3.14

## [14.9.5] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Added an `isError?: boolean` field on `AgentToolResult` so tools can flag a non-throwing failure (e.g. an aggregator that catches per-entry errors). `coerceToolResult` preserves the flag and the agent loop surfaces it as a tool error on the wire.

## [14.9.3] - 2026-05-10
### Added

- Added `onHarmonyLeak` option on `Agent`/loop config to receive GPT-5 Harmony leak audit callbacks
- Added harmony-leak detection and audit exports to the package index for programmatic leak detection and recovery hooks

### Changed

- Changed OpenAI Codex model runs to detect GPT-5 Harmony protocol leakage during streaming and automatically retry or recover tool calls instead of sending contaminated arguments downstream

### Security

- Hardened tool-call handling against leaked `to=functions.*` protocol tails by truncating or retrying before execution
- Hardened failure handling so repeated GPT-5 Harmony leak mitigation is retried only up to two times before escalating to an explicit error

## [14.9.0] - 2026-05-10
### Added

- Added `Agent#metadata` field forwarded to every API request; callers can set arbitrary provider metadata (e.g. `metadata.user_id`) once and have it applied to all subsequent stream calls without modifying per-call options
- Added `Agent#setMetadataResolver(fn)` for installing a function that resolves request metadata at call time. The `metadata` getter dispatches through the resolver on every read (including the snapshot taken per `prompt()`), so callers reflect mutable external state (e.g. live OAuth account UUID after a token refresh) without manual re-syncs. Plain `agent.metadata = …` continues to set a static value and clears any installed resolver.

### Added

- Added an `onSseEvent` agent option and loop config forwarding path for raw provider SSE diagnostics.

## [14.7.6] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Added `hideThinkingSummary` option/getter/setter on `Agent` and `AgentLoopConfig`. Forwarded to the underlying stream call so providers can omit reasoning/thinking summaries on demand.
## [14.7.2] - 2026-05-06
### Added

- Added `loadMode` option to `AgentTool` to mark built-in tools as `essential` for initial loading or `discoverable` for search activation
- Added optional `summary` field to `AgentTool` definitions for one-line text used in tool discovery indexes

## [14.7.0] - 2026-05-04
### Breaking Changes

- Changed `Agent` API types so `systemPrompt` is now a list of prompt strings, requiring callers to pass and update system prompts via string arrays

### Changed

- Removed automatic project-context injection into each model call from loop logic

### Removed

- Removed the `projectPrompt` field from agent state/context and the `setProjectPrompt` mutator

## [14.6.2] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed

- Fixed unhandled promise rejection when `getApiKey` or any other async error occurs during `streamAssistantResponse`: agent loop IIFEs now catch and route errors through `EventStream.fail()`, which terminates the `for await` loop and lets `Agent#runLoop`'s catch block create a proper error assistant message instead of crashing

## [14.6.0] - 2026-05-02
### Fixed

- Fixed request cancellation before provider events by emitting an aborted assistant message and ending the stream with `stopReason: "aborted"`

## [14.5.10] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Added an `onResponse` stream option for observing provider response metadata after response headers arrive.

## [14.2.0] - 2026-04-23

### Changed

- Changed tool dispatch to match model-returned tool calls by either internal tool name or custom wire name, enabling custom OpenAI tool names such as `apply_patch`.

## [14.0.1] - 2026-04-08
### Added

- Added `onAssistantMessageEvent` callback option to inspect assistant streaming events before they are emitted, enabling abort decisions before buffered events continue flowing
- Added `setAssistantMessageEventInterceptor()` method to dynamically set or update the assistant message event interceptor

## [13.13.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- Added `startup.checkUpdate` setting, set to `true` by default, can be disabled to skip the update check on agent initialization

## [13.12.7] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- Added overload for `prompt()` method accepting a string input with optional options parameter

### Fixed

- Fixed stale forced toolChoice being passed to provider after tools are refreshed mid-turn

## [13.9.16] - 2026-03-10
### Added

- Added `onPayload` option to `AgentOptions` to inspect or replace provider payloads before they are sent

## [13.9.3] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- Exported `ThinkingLevel` selector constants and types for configuring agent reasoning behavior
- Added `inherit` thinking level option to defer reasoning configuration to higher-level selectors
- Added `serviceTier` option to configure service tier for agent requests

### Changed

- Changed `thinkingLevel` from required string to optional `Effort` type, allowing undefined state
- Updated `setThinkingLevel()` method to accept `Effort | undefined` instead of `ThinkingLevel` string

## [13.4.0] - 2026-03-01
### Added

- Added `getToolChoice` option to dynamically override tool choice per LLM call

## [13.3.8] - 2026-02-28
### Changed

- Changed intent field name from `agent__intent` to `_i` in tool schemas

### Fixed

- Fixed synthetic tool result text formatting so aborted/error tool results no longer emit `Tool execution was aborted.: Request was aborted` style punctuation.
## [13.3.7] - 2026-02-27
### Added

- Added `lenientArgValidation` option to tools to allow graceful handling of argument validation errors by passing raw arguments to execute() instead of returning an error to the LLM

## [13.3.1] - 2026-02-26
### Added

- Added `topP`, `topK`, `minP`, `presencePenalty`, and `repetitionPenalty` options to `AgentOptions` for fine-grained sampling control
- Added getter and setter properties for sampling parameters on the `Agent` class to allow runtime configuration

## [13.1.0] - 2026-02-23

### Changed

- Removed per-tool `agent__intent` field description from injected schema to reduce token usage; intent format is now documented once in the system prompt instead of repeated in every tool definition
## [12.19.0] - 2026-02-22
### Changed

- Updated tool result messages to include error details when tool execution fails

## [12.14.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- Added `intentTracing` option to enable intent goal extraction from tool calls, allowing models to specify high-level goals via a required `_intent` field that is automatically injected into tool schemas and stripped from arguments before execution

## [12.11.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- Exported `AgentBusyError` exception class for handling concurrent agent operations

### Changed

- Agent now throws `AgentBusyError` instead of generic `Error` when attempting concurrent operations

## [12.8.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- Added `transformToolCallArguments` option to `AgentOptions` and `AgentLoopConfig` for transforming tool call arguments before execution (e.g. secret deobfuscation)

## [12.2.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- Added `providerSessionState` option to share provider state map for session-scoped transport and session caches
- Added `preferWebsockets` option to hint that websocket transport should be preferred when supported by the provider implementation

## [11.10.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- Added `temperature` option to `AgentOptions` to control LLM sampling temperature
- Added `temperature` getter and setter to `Agent` class for runtime configuration

## [11.6.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- Resume queued steering and follow-up messages from `continue()` after auto-compaction

### Changed

- Extracted `dequeueSteeringMessages()` and `dequeueFollowUpMessages()` from inline config callbacks
- Added `skipInitialSteeringPoll` option to `_runLoop()` for correct queue resume ordering

## [11.3.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added

- Added `maxRetryDelayMs` option to AgentOptions to cap server-requested retry delays, allowing higher-level retry logic to handle long waits with user visibility

### Changed

- Updated ThinkingLevel documentation to include support for gpt-5.3 and gpt-5.3-codex models with 'xhigh' thinking level

## [11.2.0] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

- Fixed handling of aborted requests to properly throw abort errors when stream terminates without a terminal event

## [10.5.0] - 2026-02-04

### Added

- Added `concurrency` option to `AgentTool` to control tool scheduling: "shared" (default, runs in parallel) or "exclusive" (runs alone)
- Implemented parallel execution of shared tools within a single agent turn for improved performance

### Changed

- Refactored tool execution to support concurrent scheduling with proper interrupt handling and steering message checks

## [9.2.2] - 2026-01-31

- Ensured tool_use/tool_result pairing is maintained when tool execution fails

## [4.6.0] - 2026-01-12

### Changed

- Modified assistant message handling to split messages around tool results for improved readability when using Cursor tools

### Fixed

- Fixed tool result ordering in Cursor mode by buffering results and emitting them at the correct position within assistant messages

## [4.3.0] - 2026-01-11

### Added

- Added `cursorExecHandlers` and `cursorOnToolResult` options for local tool execution with cursor-based streaming
- Added `emitExternalEvent` method to allow external event injection into the agent state

## [4.0.0] - 2026-01-10

### Added

- Added `popLastSteer()` and `popLastFollowUp()` methods to remove and return the last queued message (LIFO) for dequeue operations
- `thinkingBudgets` option on `Agent` and `AgentOptions` to customize token budgets per thinking level
- `sessionId` option on `Agent` to forward session identifiers to LLM providers for session-based caching

### Fixed

- `minimal` thinking level now maps to `minimal` reasoning effort instead of being treated as `low`

## [3.33.0] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed

- Ensured aborted assistant responses always include an error message for callers.
- Filtered thinking blocks from Cerebras request context to keep multi-turn prompts compatible.

## [3.21.0] - 2026-01-06

### Changed

- Switched from local `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai` to upstream `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai` package

### Added

- Added `sessionId` getter/setter on Agent class for runtime session switching

## [3.20.0] - 2026-01-06

### Breaking Changes

- Replaced `queueMessage`/`queueMode` with steering + follow-up queues: use `steer`, `setSteeringMode`, and `getSteeringMode` for mid-run interruptions, and `followUp`, `setFollowUpMode`, and `getFollowUpMode` for post-turn messages
- Agent loop callbacks now use `getSteeringMessages` and `getFollowUpMessages` instead of `getQueuedMessages`

### Added

- Added follow-up message queue support so new user messages can continue a run after the agent would otherwise stop
- Added `RenderResultOptions.spinnerFrame` for animated tool-result rendering

### Changed

- `prompt()` and `continue()` now throw when the agent is already streaming; use steering or follow-up queues instead

## [3.4.1337] - 2026-01-03

### Added

- Added `popMessage()` method to Agent class for removing and retrieving the last message
- Added abort signal checks during response streaming for faster interruption handling

### Fixed

- Fixed abort handling to properly return aborted message state when stream is interrupted mid-response

## [1.341.0] - 2026-01-03

### Added

- Added `interruptMode` option to control when queued messages interrupt tool execution.
- Implemented "immediate" mode (default) to check queue after each tool and interrupt remaining tools.
- Implemented "wait" mode to defer queue processing until the entire turn completes.
- Added getter and setter methods for `interruptMode` on Agent class.

## [1.337.1] - 2026-01-02

### Changed

- Forked to @oh-my-pi scope with unified versioning across all packages

## [1.337.0] - 2026-01-02

Initial release under @oh-my-pi scope. See previous releases at [badlogic/pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono).

## [0.31.0] - 2026-01-02

### Breaking Changes

- **Transport abstraction removed**: `ProviderTransport`, `AppTransport`, and `AgentTransport` interface have been removed. Use the `streamFn` option directly for custom streaming implementations.

- **Agent options renamed**:
  - `transport` → removed (use `streamFn` instead)
  - `messageTransformer` → `convertToLlm`
  - `preprocessor` → `transformContext`

- **`AppMessage` renamed to `AgentMessage`**: All references to `AppMessage` have been renamed to `AgentMessage` for consistency.

- **`CustomMessages` renamed to `CustomAgentMessages`**: The declaration merging interface has been renamed.

- **`UserMessageWithAttachments` and `Attachment` types removed**: Attachment handling is now the responsibility of the `convertToLlm` function.

- **Agent loop moved from `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai`**: The `agentLoop`, `agentLoopContinue`, and related types have moved to this package. Import from `@oh-my-pi/pi-agent` instead.

### Added

- `streamFn` option on `Agent` for custom stream implementations. Default uses `streamSimple` from pi-ai.

- `streamProxy()` utility function for browser apps that need to proxy LLM calls through a backend server. Replaces the removed `AppTransport`.

- `getApiKey` option for dynamic API key resolution (useful for expiring OAuth tokens like GitHub Copilot).

- `agentLoop()` and `agentLoopContinue()` low-level functions for running the agent loop without the `Agent` class wrapper.

- New exported types: `AgentLoopConfig`, `AgentContext`, `AgentTool`, `AgentToolResult`, `AgentToolUpdateCallback`, `StreamFn`.

### Changed

- `Agent` constructor now has all options optional (empty options use defaults).

- `queueMessage()` is now synchronous (no longer returns a Promise).
