# Custom Tools

Custom tools are model-callable functions that plug into the same tool execution pipeline as built-in tools.

A custom tool is a TypeScript/JavaScript module that exports a factory. The factory receives a host API (`CustomToolAPI`) and returns one tool or an array of tools.

## What this is (and is not)

- **Custom tool**: callable by the model during a turn (`execute` + Zod parameter schema).
- **Extension**: lifecycle/event framework that can register tools and intercept/modify events.
- **Hook**: external pre/post command scripts.
- **Skill**: static guidance/context package, not executable tool code.

If you need the model to call code directly, use a custom tool.

## Integration paths in current code

There are two active integration styles:

1. **SDK-provided custom tools** (`options.customTools`)
   - Wrapped into agent tools via `CustomToolAdapter` or extension wrappers.
   - Always included in the initial active tool set in SDK bootstrap.

2. **Filesystem-discovered modules via loader API** (`discoverAndLoadCustomTools` / `loadCustomTools`)
   - Exposed as library APIs in `src/extensibility/custom-tools/loader.ts`.
   - Host code can call these to discover and load tool modules from config/provider/plugin paths.

   ├─ onUpdate(...)  -> streamed partial result
   └─ return result  -> final tool content/details
```

## Discovery locations (loader API)

`discoverAndLoadCustomTools(configuredPaths, cwd, builtInToolNames)` merges:

1. Capability providers (`toolCapability`), including:
   - Native OMP config (`~/.omp/agent/tools`, `.omp/tools`)
   - Claude config (`~/.claude/tools`, `.claude/tools`)
   - Codex config (`~/.codex/tools`, `.codex/tools`)
   - Claude marketplace plugin cache provider
2. Installed plugin manifests (`~/.omp/plugins/node_modules/*` via plugin loader)
3. Explicit configured paths passed to the loader

### Important behavior

- Duplicate resolved paths are deduplicated.
- Tool name conflicts are rejected against built-ins and already-loaded custom tools.
- `.md` and `.json` files are discovered as tool metadata by some providers, but the executable module loader rejects them as runnable tools.
- Relative configured paths are resolved from `cwd`; `~` is expanded.

## Module contract

A custom tool module must export a function (default export preferred):

```ts
import type { CustomToolFactory } from "@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent";

const factory: CustomToolFactory = (pi) => ({
  name: "repo_stats",
  label: "Repo Stats",
  description: "Counts tracked TypeScript files",
  parameters: pi.zod.object({
    glob: pi.zod.string().optional().default("**/*.ts"),
  }),

  async execute(toolCallId, params, onUpdate, ctx, signal) {
    onUpdate?.({
      content: [{ type: "text", text: "Scanning files..." }],
      details: { phase: "scan" },
    });

    const result = await pi.exec(
      "git",
      ["ls-files", params.glob ?? "**/*.ts"],
      { signal, cwd: pi.cwd },
    );
    if (result.killed) {
      throw new Error("Scan was cancelled");
    }
    if (result.code !== 0) {
      throw new Error(result.stderr || "git ls-files failed");
    }

    const files = result.stdout.split("\n").filter(Boolean);
    return {
      content: [{ type: "text", text: `Found ${files.length} files` }],
      details: { count: files.length, sample: files.slice(0, 10) },
    };
  },

  onSession(event) {
    if (event.reason === "shutdown") {
      // cleanup resources if needed
    }
  },
});

export default factory;
```

Schemas are authored with Zod (`pi.zod`) and flow through the shared validation/wire pipeline.

Factory return type:

- `CustomTool`
- `CustomTool[]`
- `Promise<CustomTool | CustomTool[]>`

## API surface passed to factories (`CustomToolAPI`)

From `types.ts` and `loader.ts`:

- `cwd`: host working directory
- `exec(command, args, options?)`: process execution helper
- `ui`: UI context (can be no-op in headless modes)
- `hasUI`: `false` in non-interactive flows
- `logger`: shared file logger
- `typebox`: zod-backed compatibility shim for legacy TypeBox-style schemas
- `zod`: injected `zod/v4` module (canonical for new schemas)
- `pi`: injected `@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent` exports
- `pushPendingAction(action)`: register a preview action for hidden `resolve` tool (`docs/resolve-tool-runtime.md`)
  Loader starts with a no-op UI context and requires host code to call `setUIContext(...)` when real UI is ready.

## Execution contract and typing

`CustomTool.execute` signature:

```ts
execute(toolCallId, params, onUpdate, ctx, signal);
```

- `params` is statically typed from your Zod/TypeBox schema via `Static<TParams>`.
- Runtime argument validation happens before execution in the agent loop.
- `onUpdate` emits partial results for UI streaming.
- `ctx` includes `sessionManager`, `modelRegistry`, current `model`, `isIdle()`, `hasQueuedMessages()`, `abort()`, and optional `settings` / `autoApprove`.
- `signal` carries cancellation.

`CustomToolAdapter` bridges this to the agent tool interface and forwards calls in the correct argument order.

Tool definitions may also declare `strict`, `hidden`, `deferrable`, `mcpServerName`, `mcpToolName`, `approval`, and `formatApprovalDetails`.

## How tools are exposed to the model

- Tools are wrapped into `AgentTool` instances (`CustomToolAdapter` or extension wrappers).
- They are inserted into the session tool registry by name.
- In SDK bootstrap, custom and extension-registered tools are force-included in the initial active set.
- CLI `--tools` currently validates only built-in tool names; custom tool inclusion is handled through discovery/registration paths and SDK options.

## Rendering hooks

Optional rendering hooks:

- `renderCall(args, options, theme)`
- `renderResult(result, options, theme, args?)`

Runtime behavior in TUI:

- If hooks exist, tool output is rendered inside a `Box` container.
- `renderResult` receives `{ expanded, isPartial, spinnerFrame? }`.
- Renderer errors are caught and logged; UI falls back to default text rendering.

## Session/state handling

Optional `onSession(event, ctx)` receives session lifecycle events, including:

- `start`, `switch`, `branch`, `tree`, `shutdown`
- `auto_compaction_start`, `auto_compaction_end`
- `auto_retry_start`, `auto_retry_end`
- `ttsr_triggered`, `todo_reminder`

Use `ctx.sessionManager` to reconstruct state from history when branch/session context changes.

## Failures and cancellation semantics

### Synchronous/async failures

- Throwing (or rejected promises) in `execute` is treated as tool failure.
- Agent runtime converts failures into tool result messages with `isError: true` and error text content.
- With extension wrappers, `tool_result` handlers can further rewrite content/details and even override error status.

### Cancellation

- Agent abort propagates through `AbortSignal` to `execute`.
- Forward `signal` to subprocess work (`pi.exec(..., { signal })`) for cooperative cancellation.
- `ctx.abort()` lets a tool request abort of the current agent operation.

### onSession errors

- `onSession` errors are caught and logged as warnings; they do not crash the session.

## Real constraints to design for

- Tool names must be globally unique in the active registry.
- Prefer deterministic, schema-shaped outputs in `details` for renderer/state reconstruction.
- Guard UI usage with `pi.hasUI`.
- Treat `.md`/`.json` in tool directories as metadata, not executable modules.
