# ERRATA — GPT-5 Harmony-Header Leakage

Historical research note, not a current runtime contract. The statistics below
come from the named local stats database snapshot, not from checked-in tests or
runtime code.

## 1. The problem

OpenAI frames tool calls in the Harmony chat protocol:

```
<|start|>assistant<|channel|>commentary to=functions.<NAME><|message|>{ARGS}<|call|>
```

`<|channel|>commentary to=functions.NAME` is the **routing header** —
control tokens consumed by the runtime to dispatch the call. These
tokens never appear as content under normal operation; the runtime
strips them.

The defect: gpt-5 models occasionally emit, **as ordinary content
inside `{ARGS}`**, the **plain-text shadow** of these routing tokens —
the same characters without the `<|…|>` brackets — and continue
producing more pseudo-routing structure (channel name, body marker,
multilingual spam, fake tool-result framing). The contamination lives
inside the visible tool argument and is dispatched to the tool as if it
were intended content.

**Critical detail.** The actual `<|start|>` / `<|channel|>` /
`<|message|>` / `<|call|>` special tokens almost never appear in tool
args. What leaks is the bracket-less spelling — `analysis to=functions.X
code …` — because OpenAI applies a logit mask suppressing the
control-token IDs inside the args region. The mass that would have gone
to those special tokens redistributes onto the un-bracketed plain-text
representation the model also learned. This makes the leak structurally
invisible to the routing parser and lands it in the tool input verbatim.

Manifestation in tool args (real corpus example):

```
~      add_function(iso, ctx, ns, "installSystemChangeObserver",
        os_install_system_change_observer);】【"】【analysis to=functions.edit
        code above เงินไทยฟรีuser to=functions.edit code …
```

The leading code is real and intended. Everything after the first
non-Latin token through the next clean structural boundary is corruption.

## 2. Observed statistics & failure modes

Source: `~/.omp/stats.db` (`ss_tool_calls`, `ss_assistant_msgs`), through
2026-05-10. 1.05M tool calls scanned.

### 2.1 Rate

| Model         | Leaks in tool args |   Calls | per million |
| ------------- | -----------------: | ------: | ----------: |
| gpt-5.4       |                 37 | 226,957 |         163 |
| gpt-5.3-codex |                 17 | 112,243 |         151 |
| gpt-5.5       |                  2 |  80,750 |          25 |
| gpt-5.2-codex |                  0 |       — |           — |

Plus 15 hits in assistant visible text / thinking blobs.

### 2.2 Tool distribution

| Tool                           |   Hits |
| ------------------------------ | -----: |
| `edit`                         |     38 |
| `eval`                         |     11 |
| `report_tool_issue`            |      3 |
| `grep`/`read`/`search`/`yield` | 1 each |

Concentrated in tools with free-form (non-JSON-schema) argument formats.

### 2.3 Leak shape (deterministic)

```
LEAK         ::= JUNK_PREFIX MARKER CHANNEL_BODY (LEAK)?
MARKER       ::= "to=functions." TOOL_NAME
CHANNEL_BODY ::= " code " (SPAM | reasoning_prose | fake_tool_output)*
JUNK_PREFIX  ::= (GLITCH_TOKEN | CHANNEL_WORD | NON_LATIN_RUN | "}" | "】【")+
```

**Cascading is common.** Of 96 marker occurrences across 71 contaminated
records, 39 contain ≥2 markers and 7 contain ≥3 — the model emits
multiple fake `to=functions.X code …` blocks back-to-back, often with
fake `code_output\nCell N:\n…` framing between them. Once the
plain-text scaffolding is in the residual stream, the prefix now _looks
like_ a fresh tool envelope start, so the macro prior over continuations
keeps voting for more scaffolding. Self-amplifying.

### 2.4 Glitch tokens

Single-token identifiers in `o200k_base` whose embeddings appear to be
near-init from underrepresentation in post-training. ASCII residue
immediately before the marker in the natural corpus:

| Surface string    | Single-token | Token ID |                  Hits in corpus |
| ----------------- | :----------: | -------: | ------------------------------: |
| `Japgolly`        |      ✅      |  199,745 |                               1 |
| `Jsii`            |      ✅      |  114,318 | (subtoken of `Jsii_commentary`) |
| `Jsii_commentary` |  — (3 toks)  |        — |                               2 |
| `changedFiles`    |  — (2 toks)  |        — |                               8 |
| `RTLU`            |  — (2 toks)  |        — |                               3 |

`Japgolly` is in the last 0.13% of the vocabulary — the same family of
GitHub-corpus residue that produced `SolidGoldMagikarp` in the 2023
GPT-2 vocabulary (Rumbelow & Watkins). `SolidGoldMagikarp` itself
tokenizes to 5 tokens in `o200k_base` — that specific token was retired,
but the class wasn't.

For the multi-token entries, the corpus-level signature is the surface
string; the underlying glitch trigger is a sub-token (e.g. `Jsii` inside
`Jsii_commentary`). The detector list (`G` signal) keys on the surface
strings.

Stable across unrelated sessions. Treated as a high-precision detector
signal.

### 2.5 Channel-word leakage

`analysis` (5), `assistant` (5), `commentary` (3), `user` (1) appear
directly preceding `to=`. Always bare words; never `<|channel|>analysis`
or any other bracketed form. Consistent with §1 — the brackets are
masked, the words are not.

### 2.6 Non-Latin spam residue

96 marker hits, by script: CJK 40, Cyrillic 12, Telugu/Kannada/Malayalam
18, Thai 8, Georgian 7, Armenian 7, Arabic 1. Recurring fragments are
Chinese gambling SEO (`大发时时彩`, `天天中彩票`), Georgian/Abkhaz junk,
and Thai casino spam — well-known low-quality crawl residue.

This is the same script distribution observed in the controlled
reproduction (§7.3), independent of the prompt's natural language.

### 2.7 Failure-mode breakdown for the `edit` tool

The `edit` tool exists in two variants in the corpus:

| Variant                              | Calls | Recovery                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ----: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Patch-DSL (`§PATH`/anchor/`«»≔` ops) |    27 | **Recoverable** by op-truncation (§3.3)                                                                                                              |
| JSON-schema (`{path,edits:[…]}`)     |    11 | **Not recoverable** — contamination is escaped _inside_ JSON strings, parser accepts it cleanly, content would be written verbatim into source files |

For Patch-DSL leaks specifically:

- 20/27 cases: contamination on the last input line; nothing follows.
- 7/27 cases: contamination mid-input; what follows is one of: a
  duplicate replay of an earlier file/anchor, intended content for a
  _different_ tool call (the model started its next call inline), or
  pure hallucination. Post-contamination content is never trustworthy.

### 2.8 Mechanism (confirmed)

**Prior collapse from null-embedding glitch tokens, into a
control-token-masked basin whose mass redistributes onto the
plain-text shadow of the Harmony protocol.**

Step by step:

1. The model is mid-`{ARGS}` of a Harmony tool call. The runtime applies
   a logit mask suppressing structural control tokens (`<|channel|>`,
   `<|message|>`, `<|call|>`, `<|start|>`, `<|end|>`) inside the args
   region. Without this mask, normal generation would constantly
   hallucinate envelope-closes; with it, those token IDs have logit
   `-∞` in args.
2. A glitch token `g` is sampled. By construction `g` was in the BPE
   merge corpus but barely in LM/RL training, so its **input embedding
   `e_g` ≈ near-init noise of small norm**.
3. At position t+1, the residual update `h_{t+1} ≈ LN(h_t + e_g + Attn +
MLP)` is dominated by the prefix-derived terms; the just-emitted-token
   signal is effectively absent. Generation diversity normally comes
   from `e_x` steering the residual into different sub-regions —
   stripped here.
4. The next-token distribution therefore collapses onto the **conditional
   prior over continuations of the prefix, with local conditioning
   removed**. In a tool-calling rollout context, that prior is sharply
   peaked on Harmony scaffolding (control tokens + routing tokens) —
   that's what RL trained.
5. The mask zeros the control-token IDs. Mass redistributes onto the
   **next-best continuation**: the un-bracketed surface-form spelling of
   the same protocol (`analysis`, `commentary`, ` to=functions.X`,
   `code`). This spelling is unmasked because those characters are
   ordinary tokens.
6. Once a few tokens of plain-text scaffolding land in the residual
   stream, the prefix now resembles a fresh envelope start. The macro
   prior keeps voting for more scaffolding. Cascading (§2.3) follows.
7. Multilingual spam after the marker is the same prior-collapse
   continuation, drawn from the training neighborhood of the glitch
   token (often ESL/auto-generated multilingual web junk — exactly the
   crawl residue in §2.6).

**Two corollaries the corpus data demanded but only the experiment
explained:**

- **The brackets never appear** (§1, §2.5). The mask is what makes the
  leak land in plain text instead of as a real envelope-close.
- **Counterintuitive grammar dependency** (§7.4). The leak is _worse_ in
  formats closest to OpenAI's training distribution. Off-distribution
  custom grammars dampen the macro-prior basin; the official
  `*** Begin Patch` format is the strongest collapse target.

The 2023 SolidGoldMagikarp paper documented mechanism (1)+(2)+(4). The
new piece is (5): when constrained decoding masks the natural collapse
target, the mass laundered through the un-masked plain-text shadow
becomes a structurally-invisible exfiltration channel.
