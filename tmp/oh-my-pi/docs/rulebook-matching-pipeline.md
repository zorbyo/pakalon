# Rulebook Matching Pipeline

This document describes how coding-agent discovers rules from supported config formats, normalizes them into a single `Rule` shape, resolves precedence conflicts, and splits the result into:

- **Rulebook rules** (available to the model via system prompt + `rule://` URLs)
- **TTSR rules** (time-travel stream interruption rules)

It reflects the current implementation, including partial semantics and metadata that is parsed but not enforced.

## 1. Canonical rule shape

All providers normalize source files into `Rule`:

```ts
interface Rule {
  name: string;
  path: string;
  content: string;
  globs?: string[];
  alwaysApply?: boolean;
  description?: string;
  condition?: string[];
  scope?: string[];
  interruptMode?: "never" | "prose-only" | "tool-only" | "always";
  _source: SourceMeta;
}
```

Capability identity is `rule.name` (`ruleCapability.key = rule => rule.name`).

Consequence: precedence and deduplication are **name-based only**. Two different files with the same `name` are considered the same logical rule.

## 2. Discovery sources and normalization

`src/discovery/index.ts` auto-registers providers. For `rules`, current providers are:

- `native` (priority `100`)
- `agents` (priority `70`)
- `cursor` (priority `50`)
- `windsurf` (priority `50`)
- `cline` (priority `40`)
- `builtin-defaults` (priority `1`)

### Native provider (`builtin.ts`)

Loads `.omp` rules from:

- project: `<cwd>/.omp/rules/*.{md,mdc}` when the cwd `.omp` directory exists
- user: `~/.omp/agent/rules/*.{md,mdc}`
- sticky user rule: `~/.omp/agent/RULES.md`
- sticky project rule: nearest ancestor `.omp/RULES.md` while walking from cwd toward the repository root

Normalization:

- `name` = filename without `.md`/`.mdc`
- frontmatter parsed via `parseFrontmatter`
- `content` = body (frontmatter stripped)
- `globs`, `alwaysApply`, `description`, `condition`/legacy `ttsr_trigger`, `scope`, and `interruptMode` are parsed by `buildRuleFromMarkdown`
- top-level `RULES.md` is synthesized as rule name `RULES` and forced to `alwaysApply: true`

Important caveat: `condition` values that look like file globs are converted into `tool:edit(...)` / `tool:write(...)` scope shorthands with catch-all condition `.*`.

### Agents provider (`agents.ts`)

Loads from both `.agent` and `.agents` directories:

- project: walk upward from `cwd` to repo root, loading `<ancestor>/.agent/rules/*.{md,mdc}` and `<ancestor>/.agents/rules/*.{md,mdc}`
- user: `~/.agent/rules/*.{md,mdc}` and `~/.agents/rules/*.{md,mdc}`

Normalization uses the shared `buildRuleFromMarkdown` path: filename-derived name, stripped frontmatter body, and parsed `globs`, `alwaysApply`, `description`, `condition`/legacy `ttsr_trigger`, `scope`, and `interruptMode`.

### Cursor provider (`cursor.ts`)

Loads from:

- user: `~/.cursor/rules/*.{mdc,md}`
- project: `<cwd>/.cursor/rules/*.{mdc,md}`

Normalization (`transformMDCRule`):

- `description`: kept only if string
- `alwaysApply`: only `true` is preserved (`false` becomes `undefined`)
- `globs`: accepts array (string elements only) or single string
- `condition`/legacy `ttsr_trigger`, `scope`, and `interruptMode` are parsed by shared rule helpers
- `name` from filename without extension

### Windsurf provider (`windsurf.ts`)

Loads from:

- user: `~/.codeium/windsurf/memories/global_rules.md` (fixed rule name `global_rules`)
- project: `<cwd>/.windsurf/rules/*.md`

Normalization:

- `globs`: array-of-string or single string
- `alwaysApply`, `description`, `condition`/legacy `ttsr_trigger`, `scope`, and `interruptMode` parsed by shared rule helpers
- `name` is fixed to `global_rules` for the user global file and derived from filename for project rules

### Cline provider (`cline.ts`)

Searches upward from `cwd` for nearest `.clinerules`:

- if directory: loads `*.md` inside it
- if file: loads single file as rule named `clinerules`

Normalization:

- `globs`: array-of-string or single string
- `alwaysApply`, `description`, `condition`/legacy `ttsr_trigger`, `scope`, and `interruptMode` parsed by shared rule helpers
- `name` is fixed to `clinerules` for a `.clinerules` file and derived from filename for `.clinerules/*.md`

## 3. Frontmatter parsing behavior and ambiguity

All providers use `parseFrontmatter` (`utils/frontmatter.ts`) with these semantics:

1. Frontmatter is parsed only when content starts with `---` and has a closing `\n---`.
2. Body is trimmed after frontmatter extraction.
3. If YAML parse fails:
   - warning is logged,
   - parser falls back to simple `key: value` line parsing (`^(\w+):\s*(.*)$`).

Ambiguity consequences:

- Fallback parser does not support arrays, nested objects, quoting rules, or hyphenated keys.
- Fallback values become strings (for example `alwaysApply: true` becomes string `"true"`), so providers requiring boolean/string types may drop metadata.
- `ttsr_trigger` works in fallback (underscore key); keys like `thinking-level` would not.
- Files without valid frontmatter still load as rules with empty metadata and full content body.

## 4. Provider precedence and deduplication

`loadCapability("rules")` (`capability/index.ts`) merges provider outputs and then deduplicates by `rule.name`.

### Precedence model

- Providers are ordered by priority descending.
- Equal priority keeps registration order (`cursor` before `windsurf` from `discovery/index.ts`).
- Dedup is first-wins: first encountered rule name is kept; later same-name items are marked `_shadowed` in `all` and excluded from `items`.

Effective rule provider order is currently:

1. `native` (100)
2. `agents` (70)
3. `cursor` (50)
4. `windsurf` (50)
5. `cline` (40)
6. `builtin-defaults` (1)

### Intra-provider ordering caveat

Within a provider, item order comes from `loadFilesFromDir` glob result ordering plus explicit push order. This is deterministic enough for normal use but not explicitly sorted in code.

Notable source-order differences:

- `native` appends project `.omp/rules`, user `~/.omp/agent/rules`, user `RULES.md`, then nearest project `RULES.md`.
- `agents` appends project-walk `.agent`/`.agents` rule dirs before user home dirs.
- `cursor` appends user then project results.
- `windsurf` appends user `global_rules` first, then project rules.
- `cline` loads only nearest `.clinerules` source.
- `builtin-defaults` uses the embedded rule source order.

## 5. Split into Rulebook, Always-Apply, and TTSR buckets

After rule discovery in `createAgentSession` (`sdk.ts`), `bucketRules(...)` applies session-level filtering and bucket assignment:

1. Drop rules listed in `ttsr.disabledRules`.
2. Drop rules from the `builtin-defaults` provider when `ttsr.builtinRules === false`.
3. Register rules with non-empty `condition` into `TtsrManager`; if registration succeeds, the rule is TTSR-only.
4. Put remaining `alwaysApply === true` rules into `alwaysApplyRules`.
5. Put remaining rules with `description` into `rulebookRules`.

### Bucket behavior

- **TTSR bucket**: any enabled rule with a non-empty parsed `condition` that `TtsrManager.addRule(...)` accepts. Takes priority over other buckets.
- **Always-apply bucket**: `alwaysApply === true`, not TTSR. Full content injected into system prompt. Resolvable via `rule://`.
- **Rulebook bucket**: must have description, must not be TTSR, must not be `alwaysApply`. Listed in system prompt by name+description; content read on demand via `rule://`.
- A rule with both `condition` and `alwaysApply` goes to TTSR only if TTSR registration accepts it; otherwise it can fall through to always-apply.
- A rule with both `alwaysApply` and `description` goes to always-apply only (not rulebook).

## 6. How metadata affects runtime surfaces

### `description`

- Required for inclusion in rulebook.
- Rendered in system prompt `<rules>` block.
- Missing description means rule is not available via `rule://` and not listed in system prompt rules.

### `globs`

- Carried through on `Rule`.
- Rendered as `<glob>...</glob>` entries in the system prompt rules block.
- Exposed in rules UI state (`extensions` mode list).
- Used by TTSR as a global path gate: if a TTSR rule has globs, the match context must include at least one matching file path.
- Not used to automatically select rulebook rules for `rule://`; rulebook matching remains advisory prompt behavior.

### `alwaysApply`

- Parsed and preserved by providers.
- Used in UI display (`"always"` trigger label in extensions state manager).
- Used as an exclusion condition from `rulebookRules`.
- **Full rule content is auto-injected into the system prompt** (before the rulebook rules section).
- Rule is also addressable via `rule://<name>` for re-reading.

### `condition`, `scope`, and `interruptMode`

- `condition` is the current TTSR trigger field; legacy `ttsr_trigger` / `ttsrTrigger` are accepted as fallback inputs during parsing.
- `scope` narrows TTSR matching scope. A condition token that looks like a file glob becomes `tool:edit(<glob>)` and `tool:write(<glob>)` scope entries plus catch-all condition `.*`.
- `interruptMode` can override the global TTSR interrupt mode for the rule.

## 7. System prompt inclusion path

`buildSystemPromptInternal` receives both `rules` (rulebook) and `alwaysApplyRules`.

Always-apply rules are rendered first, injecting their raw content directly into the prompt.

Rulebook rules are rendered in a `# Rules` section with:

- `Read rule://<name> when working in matching domain`
- Each rule's `name`, `description`, and optional `<glob>` list

This is advisory/contextual: prompt text asks the model to read applicable rules, but code does not enforce glob applicability.

## 8. `rule://` internal URL behavior

`RuleProtocolHandler` is registered with:

```ts
new RuleProtocolHandler({
  getRules: () => [...rulebookRules, ...alwaysApplyRules],
});
```

Implications:

- `rule://<name>` resolves against both **rulebookRules** and **alwaysApplyRules**.
- TTSR-only rules and rules with no description and no `alwaysApply` are not addressable via `rule://`.
- Resolution is exact name match.
- Unknown names return error listing available rule names.
- Returned content is raw `rule.content` (frontmatter stripped), content type `text/markdown`.

## 9. Known partial / non-enforced semantics

1. The rule providers currently loaded for `rules` are `native`, `agents`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `cline`, and embedded `builtin-defaults`; provider files for other tools may parse other config formats but do not register rule loaders.
2. `globs` metadata is surfaced to prompt/UI and is used as a global path gate for TTSR matching, but it is not used to automatically select rulebook rules for `rule://`.
3. Rule selection for `rule://` includes rulebook and always-apply rules, but not TTSR-only rules.
4. Discovery warnings (`loadCapability("rules").warnings`) are produced but `createAgentSession` does not currently surface/log them in this path.
