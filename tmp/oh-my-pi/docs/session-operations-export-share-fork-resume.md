## Export and dump

### `/export [outputPath]` (interactive)

Flow:

1. `InputController` routes `/export...` to `CommandController.handleExportCommand`.
2. The command splits on whitespace and uses only the first argument after `/export` as `outputPath`.
3. `AgentSession.exportToHtml()` calls `exportSessionToHtml(sessionManager, state, { outputPath, themeName })`.
4. On success, UI shows path and opens the file in browser.

Behavior details:

- `--copy`, `clipboard`, and `copy` arguments are explicitly rejected with a warning to use `/dump`.
- Export embeds session header/entries/leaf plus current `systemPrompt` and tool descriptions from agent state.
- No session entries are appended during export.

Caveat:

- Argument parsing is whitespace-based (`text.split(/\s+/)`), so quoted paths with spaces are not preserved as a single path by this command path.

### `--export <inputSessionFile> [outputPath]` (CLI)

Flow in `main.ts`:

1. Handled early (before interactive/session startup).
2. Calls `exportFromFile(inputPath, outputPath?)`.
3. `SessionManager.open(inputPath)` loads entries, then HTML is generated and written.
4. Process prints `Exported to: ...` and exits.

Behavior details:

- Missing input file surfaces as `File not found: <path>`.
- This path does not create an `AgentSession` and does not mutate any running session.

### `/dump` (interactive clipboard export)

Flow:

1. `CommandController.handleDumpCommand()` calls `session.formatSessionAsText()`.
2. If empty string, reports `No messages to dump yet.`
3. Otherwise copies to clipboard via native `copyToClipboard`.

Dump content includes:

- System prompt
- Active model/thinking level
- Tool definitions + parameters
- User/assistant messages
- Thinking blocks and tool calls
- Tool results and execution blocks (except `excludeFromContext` bash/python entries)
- Custom/hook/file mention/branch summary/compaction summary entries

No session persistence changes are made by dumping.

## Share

`/share` is interactive-only and always starts by exporting current session to a temp HTML file.

### Phase 1: temp export

- Temp file path: `${os.tmpdir()}/${Snowflake.next()}.html`
- Uses `session.exportToHtml(tmpFile)`
- If export fails (notably in-memory sessions), share ends with error.

### Phase 2: custom share handler (if present)

`loadCustomShare()` checks `~/.omp/agent` for first existing candidate:

- `share.ts`
- `share.js`
- `share.mjs`

Requirements:

- Module must default-export a function `(htmlPath) => Promise<CustomShareResult | string | undefined>`.

If present and valid:

- UI enters `Sharing...` loader state.
- Handler result interpretation:
  - string => treated as URL, shown and opened
  - object => `url` and/or `message` shown; `url` opened
  - `undefined`/falsy => generic `Session shared`
- Temp file is removed after completion.

Critical fallback behavior:

- If custom handler exists but loading fails, command errors and returns.
- If custom handler executes and throws, command errors and returns.
- In both failure cases, it **does not** fall back to GitHub gist.
- Gist fallback happens only when no custom share script exists.

### Phase 3: default gist fallback

Only when no custom share handler is found:

1. Validates `gh auth status`.
2. Shows `Creating gist...` loader.
3. Runs `gh gist create --public=false <tmpFile>`.
4. Parses gist URL, derives gist id, builds preview URL `https://gistpreview.github.io/?<id>`.
5. Shows both preview and gist URLs; opens preview.

Cancellation/abort semantics in share:

- Loader has `onAbort` hook that restores editor UI and reports `Share cancelled`.
- The underlying `gh gist create` command is not passed an abort signal in this code path; cancellation is UI-level and checked after command returns.

## Fork

Interactive `/fork` creates a new session from the current one and switches the active session identity.

### Preconditions and immediate guards

- If agent is streaming, `/fork` is rejected with warning.
- UI status/loading indicators are cleared before operation.

### Session-level flow

`AgentSession.fork()`:

1. Emits `session_before_switch` with `reason: "fork"` (cancellable).
2. Flushes pending writes.
3. Calls `SessionManager.fork()`.
4. Copies artifacts directory from old session namespace to new namespace (best-effort; non-ENOENT copy failures are logged, not fatal).
5. Updates `agent.sessionId`.
6. Emits `session_switch` with `reason: "fork"`.

`SessionManager.fork()` behavior:

- Requires persistent mode and existing session file.
- Creates new session id and new JSONL file path.
- Rewrites header with:
  - new `id`
  - new timestamp
  - `cwd` unchanged
  - `parentSession` set to previous session id
- Keeps all non-header entries unchanged in the new file.

### Non-persistent behavior

- In-memory session manager returns `undefined` from `fork()`.
- `AgentSession.fork()` returns `false`.
- UI reports `Fork failed (session not persisted or cancelled)`.

### CLI `--fork <id|path>`

Startup `--fork` is resolved before normal session creation:

1. `--fork` is rejected with `--no-session`.
2. Path-like values (`/`, `\`, or `.jsonl`) call `SessionManager.forkFrom(path, cwd, sessionDir)`.
3. Other values resolve via `resolveResumableSession(...)`: local sessions first, then global search when `sessionDir` is not forced. Matching accepts lowercased session id prefixes, full JSONL filename prefixes, and timestamp-stripped filename id suffixes.
4. The forked file is created in the current cwd/session-dir scope and becomes the active session manager for startup.

## Resume and continue

## Interactive `/resume`

Flow:

1. Opens session selector populated via `SessionManager.list(currentCwd, currentSessionDir)`.
2. On selection, `SelectorController.handleResumeSession(sessionPath)` calls `session.switchSession(sessionPath)`.
3. UI clears/rebuilds chat and todos, then reports `Resumed session`.

Notes:

- This picker only lists sessions in the current session directory scope.
- It does not use global cross-project search.

## CLI `--resume`

### `--resume` (no value)

- `main.ts` lists sessions for current cwd/sessionDir and opens picker.
- Selected path is opened with `SessionManager.open(selectedPath)` before session creation.

### `--resume <value>`

`createSessionManager()` resolution order:

1. If value looks like path (`/`, `\`, or `.jsonl`), open directly.
2. Else `resolveResumableSession(...)` searches:
   - current scope (`SessionManager.list(cwd, sessionDir)`)
   - global sessions (`SessionManager.listAll()`) only when no explicit `sessionDir` was provided
3. Matching accepts case-insensitive session id prefixes, full JSONL filename prefixes, and the id suffix after the timestamp in `<timestamp>_<sessionId>.jsonl`.

Cross-project id match behavior:

- If matched session cwd differs from current cwd, CLI asks:
  - `Session found in different project ... Fork into current directory? [y/N]`
- On yes: `SessionManager.forkFrom(match.path, cwd, sessionDir)` creates a new local forked file.
- On no/non-TTY default: command errors.

## CLI `--continue`

`SessionManager.continueRecent(cwd, sessionDir)`:

1. Resolves session dir for current cwd.
2. Reads terminal-scoped breadcrumb first.
3. Falls back to most recently modified session file.
4. Opens found session; if none exists, creates new session.

This is startup-only behavior; there is no interactive `/continue` slash command.

## How session switching actually mutates runtime state

`AgentSession.switchSession(sessionPath)` does the runtime transition used by resume-like operations:

1. Emit `session_before_switch` with `reason: "resume"` and `targetSessionFile` (cancellable).
2. Disconnect agent event subscription and abort in-flight work.
3. Flush current session manager writes.
4. Capture rollback state for the current session, agent messages, queued steering/follow-up/next-turn messages, model/thinking/service-tier, MCP selections, tools, and system prompt.
5. Clear queued steering/follow-up/next-turn messages.
6. `sessionManager.setSessionFile(sessionPath)` and update `agent.sessionId`.
7. Build session context from loaded entries.
8. Restore MCP selections/tools/system prompt for the target session.
9. Emit `session_switch` with `reason: "resume"`.
10. Replace agent messages from context and sync todos.
11. Close provider sessions when switching files, or when same-file reload changed replay messages.
12. Restore model (if available in current registry).
13. Restore or initialize thinking level and service tier.
14. Reconnect agent event subscription.

If any step after the capture fails, `switchSession()` restores the captured state and reconnects the previous agent subscription before rethrowing.

No new session file is created by `switchSession()` itself.

## Event emissions and cancellation points

### Switch/fork lifecycle hooks

For `newSession`, `fork`, and `switchSession`:

- Before event: `session_before_switch`
  - reasons: `new`, `fork`, `resume`
  - cancellable by returning `{ cancel: true }`
- After event: `session_switch`
  - same reason set
  - includes `previousSessionFile`

`ExtensionRunner.emit()` returns early on the first cancelling before-event result.

### Custom tool `onSession` behavior

SDK bridges extension session events to custom tool `onSession` callbacks:

- `session_switch` -> `onSession({ reason: "switch", previousSessionFile })`
- `session_branch` -> `reason: "branch"`
- `session_start` -> `reason: "start"`
- `session_tree` -> `reason: "tree"`
- `session_shutdown` -> `reason: "shutdown"`

These callbacks are observational; they do not cancel switch/fork.

### Other cancellation surfaces relevant to this doc

- `/fork` is blocked while streaming (user must wait/abort current response first).
- `/resume` selector can be cancelled by user closing selector.
- Cross-project `--resume <id>` can be cancelled by declining fork prompt.
- `/share` has UI abort path (`Share cancelled`) for gist flow; it does not wire process-kill semantics for `gh gist create` in this code path.

## Non-persistent (in-memory) session behavior

When session manager is created with `SessionManager.inMemory()` (`--no-session`):

- Session file path is absent.
- `/export` and `/share` fail with `Cannot export in-memory session to HTML` (propagated to command error UI).
- `/fork` fails because `SessionManager.fork()` requires persistence.
- `/dump` still works because it serializes in-memory agent state.
- CLI resume/continue semantics are bypassed if `--no-session` is set, because manager creation returns in-memory immediately.

## Known implementation caveats (as of current code)

- `SelectorController.handleResumeSession()` does not check the boolean result from `session.switchSession(...)`; a hook-cancelled switch can still proceed through UI "Resumed session" repaint/status path.
- `/share` custom-share failures do not degrade to default gist fallback; they terminate the command with error.
- `/export` argument tokenization is simplistic and does not preserve quoted paths with spaces.
