# Keybindings

Run `/hotkeys` inside an `omp` session to see the active chords for your current build. The list reflects any remaps loaded from disk and any bindings added by extensions.

## Customize keybindings

User remaps live in `~/.omp/agent/keybindings.yml`. The file is a YAML mapping whose keys are keybinding action IDs and whose values are either one chord string or an array of chord strings. It is not read from `~/.omp/agent/config.yml`, and there is no nested `keybindings` object.

```yaml
app.model.cycleForward: Ctrl+P
app.model.selectTemporary: Alt+P
app.plan.toggle: Alt+Shift+P
```

Chord names are case-insensitive and use the same notation shown in the UI, such as `Ctrl+P`, `Alt+Shift+P`, `Shift+Enter`, and `Ctrl+Backspace`.

Set an action to an empty array to disable it:

```yaml
app.stt.toggle: []
```

## Common action IDs

Older unqualified action names are migrated when `keybindings.yml` is loaded, but new docs and new configs should use the namespaced action IDs above. Existing `keybindings.json` files are still accepted and migrated to `keybindings.yml`; `keybindings.yaml` is also accepted.
