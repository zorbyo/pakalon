# Autonomous Memory

When the local memory backend is enabled, the agent automatically extracts durable knowledge from past sessions and injects a compact summary into future sessions for the same project. Over time it builds a project-scoped memory store — technical decisions, recurring workflows, pitfalls — that carries forward without manual effort.

Disabled by default. Enable the local summary pipeline via `/settings` or `config.yml`:

```yaml
memory:
  backend: local
```

## Usage

### What gets injected

At session start, if a memory summary exists for the current project, it is injected into the system prompt as a **Memory Guidance** block. The agent is instructed to:

- Treat memory as heuristic context — useful for process and prior decisions, not authoritative on current repo state.
- Cite the memory artifact path when memory changes the plan, and pair it with current-repo evidence before acting.
- Prefer repo state and user instruction when they conflict with memory; treat conflicting memory as stale.

### Reading memory artifacts

The agent can read memory files directly using `memory://` URLs with the `read` tool:

| URL                                    | Content                             |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `memory://root`                        | Compact summary injected at startup |
| `memory://root/MEMORY.md`              | Full long-term memory document      |
| `memory://root/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | A generated skill playbook          |

### `/memory` slash command

| Subcommand            | Effect                                                    |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `view`                | Show the current backend injection payload                |
| `stats`               | Show backend-specific memory statistics, when supported   |
| `diagnose`            | Show backend-specific diagnostics, when supported         |
| `clear` / `reset`     | Delete active backend memory data/artifacts               |
| `enqueue` / `rebuild` | Force consolidation/retention work for the active backend |

## How it works

Local summary memories are built by a background pipeline that runs at startup or when manually triggered via slash command. The pipeline is skipped for subagents and for sessions that are not persisted to a session file.

**Phase 1 — per-session extraction:** For each past session that has changed since it was last processed, a model reads the session history and extracts durable signal: technical decisions, constraints, resolved failures, recurring workflows. Sessions that are too recent, too old, currently active, or beyond the configured scan/age limits are skipped. Each extraction produces a raw memory block and a short synopsis for that session.

**Phase 2 — consolidation:** After extraction, a second model pass reads all per-session extractions and produces three outputs written to disk:

- `MEMORY.md` — a curated long-term memory document
- `memory_summary.md` — the compact text injected at session start
- `skills/` — reusable procedural playbooks, each in its own subdirectory

Phase 2 uses a lease and heartbeat to prevent double-running when multiple processes start simultaneously. Stale skill directories from prior runs are pruned automatically.

Consolidated output is redacted for common secret/token patterns before `MEMORY.md`, `memory_summary.md`, or generated skills are written to disk.

### Extraction behavior

Memory extraction and consolidation behavior is driven by static prompt files in `packages/coding-agent/src/prompts/memories/`.

| File                  | Purpose                                     | Variables                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `stage_one_system.md` | System prompt for per-session extraction    | —                                           |
| `stage_one_input.md`  | User-turn template wrapping session content | `{{thread_id}}`, `{{response_items_json}}`  |
| `consolidation.md`    | Prompt for cross-session consolidation      | `{{raw_memories}}`, `{{rollout_summaries}}` |
| `read_path.md`        | Memory guidance injected into live sessions | `{{memory_summary}}`                        |

### Model selection

Memory piggybacks on the model role system.

| Phase                   | Role                                                                | Purpose                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Phase 1 (extraction)    | `default`                                                           | Per-session knowledge extraction |
| Phase 2 (consolidation) | `smol` (falls back to `default`, then current/first registry model) | Cross-session synthesis          |

If the requested memory role is not configured, memory model resolution falls back to the `default` role, then the active session model, then the first model in the registry.

## Configuration

| Setting                               | Default | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `memory.backend`                      | `off`   | Select `local` for this pipeline; legacy `memories.enabled: true` is migrated to `memory.backend: local` when no explicit backend is set |
| `memories.maxRolloutAgeDays`          | `30`    | Sessions older than this are not processed                                                                                               |
| `memories.minRolloutIdleHours`        | `12`    | Sessions active more recently than this are skipped                                                                                      |
| `memories.maxRolloutsPerStartup`      | `64`    | Cap on sessions processed in a single startup                                                                                            |
| `memories.summaryInjectionTokenLimit` | `5000`  | Max tokens of the summary injected into the system prompt                                                                                |

Additional tuning knobs (concurrency, lease durations, token budgets) are available in config for advanced use.
