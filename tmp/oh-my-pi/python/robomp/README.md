# roboomp

Self-hosted GitHub triage bot. Drives [`omp --mode rpc`](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi)
as a subprocess against a per-issue git worktree, then writes back to GitHub
through a sidecar that holds the PAT.

On `issues.opened` in an allowlisted repo it classifies the issue, labels it,
and branches:

- `bug` / `documentation` → reproduce, fix on a fresh branch, open a PR whose
  body has `## Repro` / `## Cause` / `## Fix` / `## Verification` and
  `Fixes #N`.
- `question` → one comment, suffixed with a 👎-to-keep-open prompt; if the
  issue author doesn't react 👎 within `ROBOMP_QUESTION_AUTOCLOSE_HOURS`
  (default 4), the issue auto-closes as `state_reason=completed`. A follow-up
  comment or external close cancels the schedule synchronously.
- `enhancement` / `proposal` → one comment, no PR.
- `invalid` / `duplicate` → one brief comment.

Follow-up issue comments and PR review comments resume the same omp session
(`--continue` against the persisted JSONL transcript). On orchestrator
restart, in-flight events are re-queued and resume the same way.

## Architecture

Two containers, one trust boundary:

- **robomp** — FastAPI + sqlite event queue + `WorkerPool` running `omp` in
  per-issue worktrees under `/data/workspaces/`. Holds the HMAC key, never
  the PAT.
- **gh-proxy** — sibling on an `internal: true` network. Holds `GITHUB_TOKEN`,
  verifies HMAC-signed requests from robomp, executes REST + `git push`.
  Only egress to `api.github.com`.

Flow: webhook → HMAC verify → `github_events.route` → sqlite `events`
(dedup on `X-GitHub-Delivery`) → `WorkerPool` claims under
`BEGIN IMMEDIATE` with an in-process `_inflight` set per `(owner, repo, n)`
→ `sandbox.ensure_workspace` produces a worktree on `farm/<8hex>/<slug>`
→ `worker.run_task` spawns `omp --mode rpc` with `cwd=worktree`,
persistent `session_dir`, model randomly drawn from `ROBOMP_MODEL` (CSV).

The agent uses omp's built-in tools (`read`/`edit`/`bash`/`lsp`, scoped to
the worktree) plus the host tools in `src/host_tools.py` — the
exclusive surface for GitHub writes. Every host-tool invocation is audited
into the `tool_calls` table with credential-redacted args and results.

## Setup

Requires Docker Compose v2 and a LiteLLM-style proxy on the host that your
`~/.omp/agent/models.container.yml` points at (mounted into the container as `models.yml`; kept under a separate filename on the host so the host omp doesn't route through the gateway). roboomp lives inside the oh-my-pi
monorepo at `python/robomp/`; both the docker build context and the
`/work/pi` bind mount default to the parent monorepo (`../..`). Override
`PI_ROOT` only if you want a different oh-my-pi checkout backing the build
and runtime.

Bot account needs **Write** on every repo in `ROBOMP_REPO_ALLOWLIST`. A
fine-grained PAT with Contents / Issues / Pull requests RW + Metadata R is
enough.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env
openssl rand -hex 32              # ROBOMP_GH_PROXY_HMAC_KEY
openssl rand -hex 32              # GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET

bun run pi:image                  # build oh-my-pi/pi:dev (one-time / on pi change)
bun run robomp:build && bun run robomp:up
curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/healthz
```

The bundled `docker-compose.yml` runs in gh-proxy mode by default. To run
the orchestrator directly with the PAT in-process (host CLI, tests),
comment out `ROBOMP_GH_PROXY_URL` / `ROBOMP_GH_PROXY_HMAC_KEY` and set
`GITHUB_TOKEN`. The two modes are mutually exclusive (`config.py`
rejects a `.env` setting both).

Build invalidation is bounded: editing roboomp Python touches only the
runtime layer; editing pi source rebuilds `oh-my-pi/pi:dev`, which
roboomp's `Dockerfile.robomp` extends via `FROM ${PI_BASE}`.

### Public URL

roboomp does not ship a tunnel. Cloudflare, smee, ngrok are all fine. The
recommended ingress rule restricts the public hostname to
`/webhook/github` exactly; `/healthz`, `/events`, `/issues`, `/replay`
stay localhost-only.

### GitHub webhook

In *Settings → Webhooks*: payload URL `https://…/webhook/github`, content
type `application/json`, secret = `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, events =
*Issues, Issue comments, Pull requests, Pull request reviews, Pull
request review comments*. GitHub's `ping` should produce
`POST /webhook/github 202` within a second.

### Configuration

See `.env.example` for the authoritative variable list. The shipped
`docker-compose.yml` uses per-service `environment:` allowlists rather
than `env_file:`, so `GITHUB_TOKEN` only reaches the gh-proxy container.

## CLI

The container entrypoint is `python -m robomp serve`. Other commands run
inside the running container:

```bash
docker compose exec robomp robomp triage  owner/repo#123   # synthesize an issues.opened and wait
docker compose exec robomp robomp replay  <delivery_id>    # re-enqueue a stored event and wait
docker compose exec robomp robomp status                   # dump issues table
docker compose exec robomp robomp cleanup owner/repo#123   # force workspace removal, state=abandoned
```

`bun run robomp:…` shortcuts in the root `package.json` cover the common
lifecycle commands (`robomp:dev`, `robomp:build`, `robomp:up`, `robomp:down`,
`robomp:logs`, `robomp:restart`, `robomp:reset`).

## Tests

```bash
pytest -x tests/                              # unit suite, no network
ROBOMP_INTEGRATION=1 pytest -x tests/test_worker_smoke.py
```

The integration test spawns a real `omp --mode rpc` against an
`httpx.MockTransport` GitHub and a local bare repo, so it needs `omp` on
`PATH`. `bun run test:py` runs the unit suite.

## Security posture

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` lives only in the gh-proxy container. The orchestrator
  refuses to start if it sees `GITHUB_TOKEN` in its own environment.
- Orchestrator → gh-proxy is HMAC-SHA256 signed with a ±30s skew window
  and constant-time compare.
- `git push` inside gh-proxy uses `git -c http.extraheader=…` with the
  token passed through an ephemeral process env var; the remote URL in
  `.git/config` stays token-free.
- gh-proxy has no host port. The `robomp_internal` network is
  `internal: true` (no ingress, no egress); gh-proxy joins `default`
  only to reach `api.github.com`.
- Agent subprocess env is scrubbed of `GITHUB_TOKEN` /
  `ROBOMP_GH_PROXY_HMAC_KEY` / friends via `worker._SCRUBBED_ENV_KEYS`.
- Webhook signatures: bad sig → `401` (so GitHub stops retrying), never
  `5xx`.
- `git` errors flow through `git_ops.GitCommandError` which redacts
  `https://user:pw@host` to `https://***@host` from argv, stdout, stderr
  before raising. `host_tools._audit` only records agent-supplied args.
- Pre-push gates (`gh_push_branch`): branch matches the workspace
  branch, working tree clean, every commit on
  `origin/<default>..HEAD` carries `ROBOMP_GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` +
  `ROBOMP_GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`.
- Pre-PR gates (`gh_open_pr`): when the repo defines them, `bun run fix`
  runs first (any diff auto-committed as `style: bun run fix`) and then
  `bun check`. A failing `bun check` returns to the agent as
  `RpcCommandError` for iteration.
- `gh_open_pr` validates `## Repro` / `## Cause` / `## Fix` /
  `## Verification` headers and a `Fixes`/`Closes`/`Resolves #N`
  reference before opening.

## Operational notes

- **One PR per issue.** Follow-up events push amendments to the same
  `farm/<hex>/<slug>` branch.
- **No PR without a recorded repro.** Persona prompt requires
  `repro_record`; `mark_unable_to_reproduce` closes the loop when
  reproduction genuinely fails.
- **Crash recovery.** On startup, `db.reset_stuck_running()` flips
  `running` rows back to `queued`. Existing `<session_dir>/*.jsonl`
  triggers `--continue`. Drain bounded by
  `ROBOMP_SHUTDOWN_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (25s) +
  `ROBOMP_SHUTDOWN_KILL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (5s); compose
  `stop_grace_period: 30s` covers both.
- **Logs.** Structured JSON on stdout, rotated to
  `/data/logs/robomp.log.jsonl`.
- **Inspection** (localhost only): `GET /events?limit=N`,
  `GET /issues?limit=N`, `GET /healthz`, `GET /readyz`, and the
  dashboard at `/`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| `401 invalid signature` | `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` mismatch with the repo webhook config. |
| Container exits with `PI_ROOT … missing` | `/work/pi` mount empty inside the container; on the host either run `docker compose` from `python/robomp/` so `PI_ROOT` defaults to `../..`, or export `PI_ROOT` to a valid oh-my-pi checkout. |
| `git push: Authentication required` | Bot PAT lacks push, or `ROBOMP_BOT_LOGIN` ≠ PAT's account. |
| `refusing to push: commit author identity mismatch` | Some commit not authored as `ROBOMP_GIT_AUTHOR_*`. The error lists the offending shas; `git commit --amend --reset-author --no-edit`. |
| `refusing to push: working tree is dirty` | Uncommitted agent edits. Or just call `gh_open_pr`, which auto-commits `bun run fix` output. |
| `bun check failed before PR creation` | Fix the reported failure and retry `gh_open_pr`. |
| `Failed to load pi_natives` | Wrong arch / missing native. `bun run pi:image` then `bun run robomp:build`. |
| `No API key found for <provider>` | `~/.omp/agent/models.container.yml` mount missing or provider id mismatch with `ROBOMP_MODEL`. |
