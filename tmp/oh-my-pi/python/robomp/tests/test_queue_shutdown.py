"""Graceful shutdown drain + kill behavior on WorkerPool.

These tests poke `WorkerPool` directly: they don't spin up a dispatcher loop
or omp subprocess. The contract under test is `stop()`'s drain-then-kill
sequence and `_run_event`'s shutting-down branch that leaves the DB row in
`running` so `reset_stuck_running()` can requeue it.
