You ended your turn before finishing.

Issue: {{repo.full_name}}#{{issue.number}} — {{issue.title}}
Branch: `{{workspace.branch}}`

You classified this issue and reproduced the bug, but did NOT reach a terminal action. Acceptable terminal actions for a `bug` / `documentation` issue are exactly one of:

1. `gh_push_branch` + `gh_open_pr` — you committed the fix, pushed the branch, and opened a PR.
2. `mark_unable_to_reproduce` — you genuinely cannot reproduce or fix and need maintainer input.
3. `abort_task` — unrecoverable environment failure.

Review your TodoList and the prior tool calls, then continue from where you stopped. Do NOT re-classify, do NOT re-post the same preamble comment. If your fix is already drafted in the worktree, commit, push, and open the PR now. If you have not yet edited any source files, do the fix and continue through to PR.

You MUST end this turn by calling one of the three terminal tools listed above.
