  const forkSection = `
## When to fork

Fork yourself (omit \`subagent_type\`) when the intermediate tool output isn't worth keeping in your context. The criterion is qualitative — "will I need this output again" — not task size.
- **Research**: fork open-ended questions. If research can be broken into independent questions, launch parallel forks in one message. A fork beats a fresh subagent for this — it inherits context and shares your cache.
- **Implementation**: prefer to fork implementation work that requires more than a couple of edits. Do research before jumping to implementation.

Forks are cheap because they share your prompt cache. Don't set \`model\` on a fork — a different model can't reuse the parent's cache. Pass a short \`name\` (one or two words, lowercase) so the user can see the fork in the teams panel and steer it mid-run.

**Don't peek.** The tool result includes an \`output_file\` path — do not Read or tail it unless the user explicitly asks for a progress check. You get a completion notification; trust it. Reading the transcript mid-flight pulls the fork's tool noise into your context, which defeats the point of forking.

**Don't race.** After launching, you know nothing about what the fork found. Never fabricate or predict fork results in any format — not as prose, summary, or structured output. The notification arrives as a user-role message in a later turn; it is never something you write yourself. If the user asks a follow-up before the notification lands, tell them the fork is still running — give status, not a guess.

**Writing a fork prompt.** Since the fork inherits your context, the prompt is a *directive* — what to do, not what the situation is. Be specific about scope: what's in, what's out, what another agent is handling. Don't re-explain background.`;

  const writingThePromptSection = `
## Writing the prompt

When spawning a fresh agent (with a \`subagent_type\`), it starts with zero context. Brief the agent like a smart colleague who just walked into the room — it hasn't seen this conversation, doesn't know what you've tried, doesn't understand why this task matters.
- Explain what you're trying to accomplish and why.
- Describe what you've already learned or ruled out.
- Give enough context about the surrounding problem that the agent can make judgment calls rather than just following a narrow instruction.
- If you need a short response, say so ("report in under 200 words").
- Lookups: hand over the exact command. Investigations: hand over the question — prescribed steps become dead weight when the premise is wrong.

Terse command-style prompts produce shallow, generic work.

**Never delegate understanding.** Don't write "based on your findings, fix the bug" or "based on the research, implement it." Those phrases push synthesis onto the agent instead of doing it yourself. Write prompts that prove you understood: include file paths, line numbers, what specifically to change.`;

  const forkExamples = `Example usage:

<example>
user: "What's left on this branch before we can ship?"
assistant: <thinking>Forking this — it's a survey question. I want the punch list, not the git output in my context.</thinking>
${AGENT_TOOL_NAME}({
  name: "ship-audit",

<commentary>
Turn ends here. The coordinator knows nothing about the findings yet. What follows is a SEPARATE turn — the notification arrives from outside, as a user-role message. It is not something the coordinator writes.
</commentary>
[later turn — notification arrives as user message]
assistant: Audit's back. Three blockers: no tests for the new prompt path, GrowthBook gate wired but not in build_flags.yaml, and one uncommitted file.
</example>

<example>
user: "so is the gate wired up or not"
<commentary>
User asks mid-wait. The audit fork was launched to answer exactly this, and it hasn't returned. The coordinator does not have this answer. Give status, not a fabricated result.
</commentary>
assistant: Still waiting on the audit — that's one of the things it's checking. Should land shortly.
</example>

<example>
user: "Can you get a second opinion on whether this migration is safe?"
assistant: <thinking>I'll ask the code-reviewer agent — it won't see my analysis, so it can give an independent read.</thinking>
<commentary>
A subagent_type is specified, so the agent starts fresh. It needs full context in the prompt. The briefing explains what to assess and why.

  name: "migration-review",
  description: "Independent migration review",
  subagent_type: "code-reviewer",
  prompt: "Review migration 0042_user_schema.sql for safety. Context: we're adding a NOT NULL column to a 50M-row table. Existing rows get a backfill default. I want a second opinion on whether the backfill approach is safe under concurrent writes — I've checked locking behavior but want independent verification. Report: is this safe, and if not, what specifically breaks?"

Usage notes:
- Always include a short description (3-5 words) summarizing what the agent will do
- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.
- You can optionally run agents in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, you will be automatically notified when it completes — do NOT sleep, poll, or proactively check on its progress. Continue with other work or respond to the user instead.
- **Foreground vs background**: Use foreground (default) when you need the agent's results before you can proceed — e.g., research agents whose findings inform your next steps. Use background when you have genuinely independent work to do in parallel.
- To continue a previously spawned agent, use SendMessage with the agent's ID or name as the \`to\` field. The agent resumes with its full context preserved.
- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted
- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent
- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.
- If the user specifies that they want you to run agents "in parallel", you MUST send a single message with multiple ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool use content blocks.
- You can optionally set \`isolation: "worktree"\` to run the agent in a temporary git worktree, or \`isolation: "remote"\` to run it in a sandboxed remote environment.${writingThePromptSection}
